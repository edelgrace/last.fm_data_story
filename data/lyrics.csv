Movin' on without you	浜崎あゆみ	"Nothing's gonna stop me\Only you can stop me\In the dead of night at 3am\My PHS is by my pillow\I'm waiting for it to ring\Like an idiot, right?\The clock bell sounds\Even if I found\Glass slippers like in a fairy-tale\It'd be no good\If caring for me is a bother\Then tell me quickly\Because even I\Don't have that much free time\I'm movin' on without you\I can't pretend\Like I don't know\About your stupid alibis anymore\Though it's not all\Memories like those for us\I didn't expect it to be so painful\But why is it?\I wonder if it's still too soon\To act like a good girl\Nothing's gonna stop me\Only you can stop me\The lines I've prepared to say\Are perfect\But you still haven't called\It's 4 in the morning\On the too quiet nights\My thoughts run wild\I understand\But I'm not getting enough sleep\I've already forgotten\Those promises\I'll return the ring\So give me back my heart\I have to go without you\It's hard, so\I'll break up with you\Acting like a good girl\Isn't easy\I didn't expect it to be so painful\But why is it?\I wonder if it's still too soon\To act like a good girl\Nothing's gonna stop me\Only you can stop me\It's all right to be confused\I want you to love me\And even though I don't say that\I want you to understand\I didn't expect it to be so painful\But why is it?\I wonder if it's still too soon\To act like a good girl\Nothing's gonna stop me\Only you can stop me"
Cool	Gwen Stefani	"It's hard to remember how it felt before\Now I found the love of my life\Passes things, get more comfortable\Everything is going right\\And after all the obstacles\It's good to see you now with someone else\And it's such a miracle that you and me are still good friends\After all that we've been through\I know we're cool\I know we're cool\\We used to think it was impossible\Now you call me by my new last name\Memories seem like so long ago\Time always kills the pain\\Remember Harbor Boulevard\The dreaming days where the mess was made\Look how all the kids have grown\We have changed but we're still the same\After all that we've been through\I know we're cool\I know we're cool\Yeah, I know we're cool\\And I'll be happy for you\If you can be happy for me\Circles and triangles\And now we're hanging out with your new girlfriend\So far from where we've been\I know we're cool\I know we're cool\\Cool, yeah I know we're cool\I know we're cool\Cool, yeah I know we're cool"
Lil Watan	Mashrou' Leila	"Others tamed hurricanes to control fate\and we fly away from a breeze\and if you dare ask a question about the deterioration of conditions\they shut you up with some slogans about all the conspiracies\the flock calls you a traitor whenever you want to alter your home\they despaired you so you sell your freedom when home is lost\you need to cheer up, come dance with me a bit\why are you frowning, come dance with me a bit\ \They taught you the anthem because loyalty is good for home\they drugged you in the vein and taught you the anther for home\you need to cheer up, come dance with me a bit\why are you frowning, come dance with me a bit"
Goodbye Happiness	宇多田ヒカル	"After the sweet candy's disappeared\there was a lonely boy\and a cloudless summer day\Arms and legs sunburnt, a white dress\I don't care if it gets dirtied\This is an unconscious paradise\At the end of the dream, there's no waiting\One day I learned your name\So goodbye loneliness\Humming a love song\I'm laughing as I reflect in your eyes\So goodbye happiness\I can no longer go back to that time\when I played knowing nothing\But that's fine. Love me\You mustn't think too much and despair\This transient world is child's play\When people become alone\they realize the meaning of love\Departed days\Let me hear a gentle song\Do you still remember the feelings of when we met?\So goodbye innocence\I can no longer go back to that time\when I played knowing nothing\It's your fault. Kiss me\Oh, all things turn and turn\Oh, darling, darling\I won't fall for someone else\Only you\It'd be nice if we could live the way we are\But at important moments, the other me gets in the way\So goodbye happiness\I want to go back to that time\when I played knowing nothing, baby\And then once again kiss me"

This Is How I Disappear	My Chemical Romance	"Go!\\To un-explain the unforgivable\Drain all the blood and give the kids a show\By streetlight this dark night\A séance down below\There's things that I have done\You never should ever know\\And without you is how I disappear\And live my life alone forever now\And without you is how I disappear\And live my life alone forever now\\Who walks among the famous living dead\Drowns all the boys and girls inside your bed\And if you could talk to me\Tell me if it's so\That all the good girls go to heaven\Well, heaven knows\\That without you is how I disappear\And live my life alone forever now\And without you is how I disappear\And live my life alone forever now\\Can you hear me cry out to you?\Words I thought I'd choke on, figure out\I'm really not so with you anymore\I'm just a ghost\So I can't hurt you anymore\So I can't hurt you anymore\\And now, you wanna see how far down I can sink?\Let me go, fuck!\So you can\Well, now, so you can\I'm so far away from you\Well, now, so you can\\And without you is how I disappear\And without you is how I disappear\Forever, forever now"
Red Sky	Thrice	"I know what lies beneath\I've seen the flash of teeth\Conspiring with the reef\To sink our ship\The wind's a cheating wife\Her tongue a thirsty knife\And she could take your life\With one good kiss\\Can you see the sky turn red\As morning's light breaks over me?\Know tonight we'll make our bed\At the bottom of the sea\\I know the ocean speaks\I've heard her call to me\And smiling in my dreams\She whispers this:\("The stars retreat behind their veil\The clouds are clinging to your sail\The storm is coming, can you see?")\\Can you see the sky turn red\As morning's light breaks over me?\Know tonight we'll make our bed\At the bottom of the sea\\Look and see the sky turn red\Like blood it covers over me\And soon the sea shall give up her dead\We'll raise an empire from the bottom of the sea"

Genei no Kusari	Screw	"I'm drowning in the deep darkness\Though the night damages me again to my heart\I'm getting buried in a lie that's mocking reality\Though the night kills me again to my heart\My wishes, not learning any lessons from just living\Even if I escape, I don't think I can get rid of it\The bonds control my memories\Why can't I take this life,\Which I should be able to get rid of in one second?\The blood of you, tightly fastened,\Violates me constantly, again and again\In the time of February when I felt a touch of spring\In a chilly night in which the pale plum trees are blooming\I'm wishing for myself\Criticising, so that I won't trust you with my body,\Which is dirty and unable to love\I want to destroy my heart that can't forget you,\I can't destroy it\- karma -\The blood of you, tightly fastened,\Violates me constantly, again and again\In the time of February when I felt a touch of spring\In a chilly night in which the pale plum trees are blooming\Softly, inside of your gentle, warm arms\Erase me\"
Blurry Eyes	L'Arc~en~Ciel	"The wind that comes from the faraway blows at you\Even if I repeat the words that cannot be brought across\You gaze still looked faraway and float out from the window\The same premonition (prediction) continues\Those days are stormy and dark...\Like the bird in a cage with emptiness in the eyes\The afternoon sun\Made you confused like the light out of this world\The same premonition (prediction) continues\Those days are stormy and dark...\The always-changing season robbed the restrictions of each other\Even I reached out my both hands\There is no way to bring back the heart that is had left me\Why do you stare at the sky\With your blurry eyes?\The always-changing season robbed the restrictions of each other\Even I reached out my both hands\There is no way to bring back the heart that had left me\In the always-changing season\The most important person is not here any more\Eyes that are looking back (to the past) carry a soft sigh\...heart had left me long ago..."

相愛後動物感傷	張惠妹	"A grieved cat licking his after-fight-wound beside the window\A crumpled white mattress made a mess which can't be explained\Whose cigarette butts? Keep behaving arrogantly, spreading the greedy which can't be controlled\Who is holding the umbrella? A bit of heat(warm), it's heaven or misery?\At the peak of the edge, the time always gone tardily than the clock (real-time)\Once the sweat been dried by the wind, covering the skin with the invisible sorrow\Whose relationship, can't be announced? who is acting brave in unfamiliar room.\ Who afraid of rotting in the night? Let the breaths become brutally\Let's fall in love\Occupying the shoulder to block the regrets\Let's fall in love\Chewing a pair of wing and get through another season of darkness.\Let's fall in love\Animals always acting like this, once they are not satisfy\Let's fall in love\(Let's being in love first)\Feel the blues afterward, think about solution afterward."
E Is For Estranged	Owen Pallett	"I think that 80% of a good show is rooted in humiliation\\Boys run like water from the barrel to the trough\They'll never stop their running\Gunning for their brothers\This house is a hostel\It is peaceful, but it's always emptying\Boys all want to be someone\\Haven't you heard? I am a flightless bird\I am a liar, feeding facts to a false fire\If pathos is borne, borne out of bullshit\In formal attire, I'll score you a string ensemble\\I saw my son at seventeen\The shutters made projections on his naked frame\And now at twenty-five\He simply cannot stay away from the ketamine\With makeup on his sores\He spends an hour a day composing little eulogies\Sometimes he sends me letters\But they're mostly garbled phrases and apologies\\But haven't you heard? I am a flightless bird\I am a liar, feeding facts to a false fire\If pathos is borne, borne out of bullshit\In formal attire, cue the Bulgarian men's choir"
Alone in the dark	COMEBACK MY DAUGHTERS	"Somebody, get me out of here\Somebody, take me away\We are still clinging to the dreams of our youth\It's always people like them swimming\at the blackened beach\with half canned and cold\I still remember that scene even now days\Somehow my heart felt lighter\There is someone who make no progress\My dream is still just a dream\Your smile left an impression\Have you ever felt like you are alone in the dark?"
Emily	Joanna Newsom	"The meadowlark and the chim-choo-ree and the sparrow\Set to the sky in a flying spree, for the sport of the pharaoh\Little while later the Pharisees dragged a comb through the meadow\Do you remember what they called up to you and me, in our window?\There is a rusty light on the pines tonight\Sun pouring wine, lord, or marrow\Down into the bones of the birches\And the spires of the churches\Jutting out from the shadows\The yoke, and the axe, and the old smokestacks and the bale and the barrow\And everything sloped like it was dragged from a rope\In the mouth of the south below\We've seen those mountains kneeling, felten and grey\We thought our very hearts would up and melt away\From that snow in the nighttime\Just going\And going\And the stirring of wind chimes\In the morning\In the morning\Helps me find my way back in\From the place where I have been\And, Emily - I saw you last night by the river\I dreamed you were skipping little stones across the surface of the water\Frowning at the angle where they were lost, and slipped under forever\In a mud-cloud, mica-spangled, like the sky'd been breathing on a mirror\Anyhow - I sat by your side, by the water\You taught me the names of the stars overhead that I wrote down in my ledger\Though all I knew of the rote universe were those Pleiades loosed in December\I promised you I'd set them to verse so I'd always remember\\That the meteorite is a source of the light\And the meteor's just what we see\And the meteoroid is a stone that's devoid of the fire that propelled it to thee\And the meteorite’s just what causes the light\And the meteor’s how it’s perceived\And the meteoroid’s a bone thrown from the void\That lies quiet and offering to thee\\You came and lay a cold compress upon the mess I'm in\Threw the window wide and cried, "Amen! Amen! Amen!"\The whole world stopped to hear you hollering\You looked down and saw now what was happening\The lines are fading in my kingdom\(Though I have never known the way to border them in)\So the muddy mouths of baboons and sows and the grouse and the horse and the hen\Grope at the gate of the looming lake that was once a tidy pen\And the mail is late and the great estates are not lit from within\The talk in town's becoming downright sickening\In due time we will see the far buttes lit by a flare\I've seen your bravery, and I will follow you there\And row through the nighttime\Gone healthy\Gone healthy all of a sudden\In search of the midwife\Who could help me\Who could help me\Help me find my way back in\There are worries where I've been\Say, say, say in the lee of the bay; don't be bothered\Leave your troubles here where the tugboats shear the water from the water\(Flanked by furrows, curling back, like a match held up to a newspaper)\Emily, they'll follow your lead by the letter\And I make this claim, and I'm not ashamed to say I know you better\What they've seen is just a beam of your sun that banishes winter\Let us go! Though we know it's a hopeless endeavor\The ties that bind, they are barbed and spined and hold us close forever\Though there is nothing would help me come to grips with a sky that is gaping and yawning\There is a song I woke with on my lips as you sailed your great ship towards the morning\Come on home, the poppies are all grown knee-deep by now\Blossoms all have fallen, and the pollen ruins the plow\Peonies nod in the breeze and while they wetly bow\With hydrocephalitic listlessness ants mop up-a their brow\And everything with wings is restless, aimless, drunk and dour\The butterflies and birds collide at hot, ungodly hours\And my clay-colored motherlessness rangily reclines\Come on home, now! All my bones are dolorous with vines\Pa pointed out to me, for the hundredth time tonight\The way the ladle leads to a dirt-red bullet of light\Squint skyward and listen\Loving him, we move within his borders\Just asterisms in the stars' set order\We could stand for a century\Staring\With our heads cocked\In the broad daylight at this thing\Joy\Landlocked\In bodies that don't keep\Dumbstruck with the sweetness of being\Until we don't be told\Take this\Eat this\Told"
桜流し	宇多田ヒカル	"Watching flowers just blossomed fall\“Too early, this year” you said,\In disappointment, regret\And you were beautiful\If you could see me now\I wonder what you would think\Me, living without you\Everybody finds love\In the end\If you could hear the newborn’s cry,\Sound and healthy\Ringing in the town you protected\I know you would be so pleased\The footsteps that continue after us\Everybody finds love\In the end\I can’t believe that I’ll never see you again\I haven’t told you anything yet\I haven’t told you anything yet\Watching flowers just blossomed fall\The trees stood by, helpless\However great the fear, I will not look away\If at the end of everything, there is love"

Ala Babu	Mashrou' Leila	"I’m sleeping and recall you in my dreams\I fantasize that your hand is the place of my hand\Why do I kneel down in front of you, why do I come back to you just that you strangle me\Why do I plead for you, why do I obey you just that you burn me\Tell me that I satisfy you like he satisfies you\And just kisses you where I kiss you and then you fantasize about me\My heart knocks on your door and you strangle me on my aorta\My heart throws me before your feet\It was me who protected you and you hurt me\It was me who hurt you and you protected me\Out of my flaws, my sins, my scars\In my flaws, my sins, my scars\My heart knocks on your door and you strangle me on my aorta\My heart throws me before your feet\The night goes on in my glass without me sleeping\It’s truth is it doesn’t have peace without you\My heart knocks on his door and desires his absence\My heart knocks on his door and longs for his torture"

For Miles	Thrice	"I know one day, all our scars will disappear, like the stars at dawn\And all of our pain, will fade away when morning comes\And on that day when we look backwards we will see, that everything is changed\And all of our trials, will be as milestones on the way\And as long as we live, every scar is a bridge to someone's broken heart\And there's no greater love, than that one shed his blood for his friends\On that day all of the scales will swing to set all the wrongs to right\All our tears, and all of our fears will take to flight\But until then all of our scars will still remain, but we've learned that if we'll\Open the wounds and share them then soon they start to heal\(As long as we live, we are bridges to someone broken heart\There's no greater love, shed your blood for your friends)\We must see that every scar is a bridge, and as long as we live\We must open up these wounds\When some one stands in your shoes and will shed his own blood\There's no greater love.

Time to Say Goodbye	Casey Lee Williams	"There's a point where it tips, there's a point where it breaks\There's a point where it bends and a point we just can’t take\Anymore\There's a line that we’ll cross and there’s no return;\There's a time and a place, no bridges left to burn anymore\We can’t just wait with lives at stake\Until they think we’re ready\Our enemies are gathering\The storm is growing deadly\Now it's time to say goodbye\To the things we loved and the innocence of youth\How the time seemed to fly\From our carefree lives and the solitude and peace we always knew\There's a day when we’ll fight and we’re not gonna fall\There's a day when we’ll stand\And a day when we won’t crawl anymore\There’s a moment in time and there’s no going back\When we’re pushed too hard and we won’t hold our attack\Anymore\We can’t just cling to childish things\As evil just grows closer\Humanity’s in jeopardy\This fight is far from over\Now it's time to say goodbye\To the things we loved and the innocence of youth\With a doubt in our minds\Why we chose this life and at times we can’t help wondering...\Were we born to fight and die?\Sacrificed for one huge lie?\Are we heroes keeping peace?\Or are we weapons\Pointed at the enemy\So someone else can claim a victory?\Now it's time to say goodbye\To the things we loved and the innocence of youth\How the time seemed to fly\From our carefree lives and the solitude and peace we always knew"

Only Skin	Joanna Newsom	"And there was a booming above you\That night black airplanes flew over the sea\And they were lowing and shifting like\Beached whales\Shelled snails\As you strained and you squinted to see\The retreat of their hairless and blind cavalry\You froze in your sand shoal\Prayed for your poor soul;\Sky seemed a bread roll, soaking in a milk-bowl\And when the bread broke —\Fell in bricks of wet smoke —\My sleeping heart woke, and my waking heart spoke\Then there was a silence you took to mean something:\Mean, Run, sing\For alive you will evermore be\And the plague of the greasy black engines a-skulking\Has gone east\While you’re left to explain them to me —\Released\From their hairless and blind cavalry\With your hands in your pockets\Stubbily running\To where I’m unfresh\Undressed and yawning —\Well, what is this craziness?\This crazy talking?\You caught some small death\When you were sleepwalking\It was a dark dream, darlin;\It’s over\The firebreather is beneath the clover\Beneath his breathing there is cold clay, forever:\A toothless hound-dog choking on a feather\But I took my fishing pole (fearing your fever)\Down to the swimming hole, where there grows a bitter herb\That blooms but one day a year, by the riverside —\I’d bring it here:\Apply it gently\To the love you’ve lent me\While the river was twisting and braiding, the bait bobbed\And the string sobbed\As it cut through the hustling breeze\And I watched how the water was kneading so neatly\Gone treacly\Nearly slowed to a stop in this heat;\Frenzy coiling flush along the muscles beneath\Press on me\We are restless things\Webs of seaweed are swaddling\You call upon the dusk of the\Musk of a squid:\Shot full of ink, until you sink into your crib\Rowing along, among the reeds, among the rushes\I heard your song, before my heart had time to hush it!\Smell of a stonefruit being cut and being opened\Smell of a low and of a lazy cinder smoking\And when the fire moves away\Fire moves away, son\Why would you say\I was the last one?\Scrape your knee: it is only skin\Makes the sound of violins\When I cut your hair, and leave the birds all the trimmings\I am the happiest woman among all women\And the shallow water stretches as far as I can see\Knee deep, trudging along —\The seagull weeps ‘so long’ —\I’m humming a threshing song —\Until the night is over, hold on\Hold on;\Hold your horses back from the fickle dawn\I have got some business out at the edge of town\Candy weighing both of my pockets down\Till I can hardly stay afloat, from the weight of them\(and knowing how the commonfolk condemn\What it is I do, to you, to keep you warm:\Being a woman. Being a woman.)\But always up the mountainside you’re clambering\Groping blindly, hungry for anything;\Picking through your pocket linings —\Well, what is this?\Scrap of sassafras, eh Sisyphus?\I see the blossoms broke and wet after the rain\Little sister, he will be back again\I have washed a thousand spiders down the drain\Spiders’ ghosts hang, soaked and dangling\Silently from all the blooming cherry trees\In tiny nooses, safe from everyone —\Nothing but a nuisance; gone now, dead and done —\Be a woman. Be a woman\Though we felt the spray of the waves\We decided to stay, 'till the tide rose too far\We weren’t afraid, cause we know what you are;\And you know that we know what you are\Awful atoll —\O, incalculable indiscreetness and sorrow!\Bawl bellow:\Sibyl sea-cow, all done up in a bow\Toddle and roll;\Teethe an impalpable bit of leather\While yarrow, heather and hollyhock\Awkwardly molt along the shore\Are you mine?\My heart?\Mine anymore?\Stay with me for awhile\That’s an awfully real gun\I know life will lay you down\As the lightning has lately done\Failing this, failing this\Follow me, my sweetest friend\To see what you anointed\In pointing your gun there\Lay it down! Nice and slow!\There is nowhere to go\Save up;\Up where the light, undiluted, is\Weaving, in a drunk dream\At the sight of my baby, out back:\Back on the patio\Watching the bats bring night in\— while, elsewhere\Estuaries of wax-white\Wend, endlessly, towards seashores unmapped\*\Last week, our picture window\Produced a half-word\Heavy and hollow\Hit by a brown bird\We stood and watched her gape like a rattlesnake\And pant and labor over every intake\I said a sort of prayer for some rare grace\Then thought I ought to take her to a higher place\Said, “dog nor vulture nor cat shall toy with you\And though you die, bird, you will have a fine view.”\Then in my hot hand, she slumped her sick weight\We tramped through the poison oak, heartbroke and inchoate\The dogs were snapping, so you cuffed their collars\While I climbed the tree-house. Then how I hollered!\Cause she’d lain, as still as a stone, in my palm, for a lifetime or two;\Then saw the treetops, cocked her head, and up and flew\(While back in the world that moves, often, according to\The hoarding of these clues\Dogs still run roughly around\Little tufts of finch-down\The cities we passed were a flickering wasteland,\But his hand, in my hand, made them hale and harmless\While down in the lowlands, the crops are all coming;\We have everything\Life is thundering blissful towards death\In a stampede\Of his fumbling green gentleness\You stopped by;\I was all alive\In my doorway, we shucked and jived\And when you wept, I was gone;\See, I got gone when I got wise\But I can’t with certainty say we survived\Then down and down\And down and down\And down and deeper\Stoke, without sound\The blameless flames\You endless sleeper\Through fire below\And fire above\And fire within\Sleep through the things that couldn’t have been\If you hadn’t have been\And when the fire moves away\Fire moves away, son\Why would you say\I was the last one?\All my bones, they are gone, gone, gone\Take my bones, I don’t need none\Cold, cold cupboard, lord, nothing to chew on!\Suck all day on a cherry stone\Dig a little hole not three inches round —\Spit your pit in a hole in the ground\Weep upon the spot for the starving of me!\Till up grows a fine young cherry tree\When the bough breaks, what’ll you make for me?\A little willow cabin to rest on your knee\What’ll I do with a trinket such as this?\Think of your woman, who’s gone to the west\But I’m starving and freezing in my measly old bed!\Then I’ll crawl across the salt flats, to stroke your sweet head\Come across the desert with no shoes on!\I love you truly\Or I love no-one\Fire moves away. Fire moves away, son\Why would you say that I was the last one, last one?\Clear the room! There’s a fire, a fire, a fire\Get going\And I’m going to be right behind you\And if the love of a woman or two, dear\Couldn't move you to such heights\Then all I can do\Is do, my darling, right by you"

DEATH	::M∆DE::IN::HEIGHTS::	"Feel it rush like a hush in the attic, bae\You could see me blush when I tell you all about it\In a moment hit the switch, then a moment in the dark\Then a moment so pervasive it was breaking us apart\The galaxy is spreading like a rumor in your jaw\Better keep your planet spinning better keep the motive tall\There’s time inside my tears making diamonds on the wall\Heavy forest summer night, I confess that I'm a lightweight\Cause fate is rolling up and hate is blowing up\If it’s a crime to bend the line then we should tear it up\And when the waters start to cross, I'll call you up\I genuinely love to hear your thoughts\Inherited these ways and they came with seven claws\Like the terror that remains every morning in the dark\And the tethers that you lace only tie you in a knot\Don’t fall for all the blame, don’t rely on the applause\Tripping for so long, I've been tripping for so long\Tripping for so long, I've been tripping for so long\Your burden was the weight of a feather\I was certain if I waited you’d remember\When the comet took me out into space\When you held your breath, looking at my face\Now I comprehend that death is not the end\And the world that we destroyed wasn't real enough to live in\But I’m alive, yes I'm alive\I can feel it running up and down my spine\ (x2)\Tripping for so long, I've been tripping for so long\Tripping for so long, I've been tripping for so long\Tripping for so long, I've been tripping for so long\Tripping for so long, I've been tripping for so long"

Silent Eve	Sadie	"I was scared of the loneliness, that I even wouldn't be able to find your whereabouts\The ideal, that I can't catch a hold of you even if I want to, wavers\The color of tears that's everlasting in the continuing rain is projected onto the outside of the window - overlapping reality\Is this a separation from necessity that is no coincidence? My voice doesn't reach you, even if it wants to return it can not\Turning my back to the truth and forcing a smile\With my words fastening there is no answer or anything else\I'm shouting in tears, my unreachable memories are breaking\Please notice my self-torture and the promise of my piled up tears\"I don't need ambiguous love nor sorrow" nearly drowning in irony I hid my real intention\The things I cared most about easily slipped through the gap in my fingers and disappeared\Night of my deepest desire that was able to prosper in my loneliness\I got lonely by simply losing everything\I can turn myself in my weakness, which is that I understand that I can not die\Someone just please tell me the reason and meaning of living\Only the sound of the rain is echoing in this tranquility\The second half of our promise, 0 o 'clock already passed\Night of my deepest desire that was able to prosper in my loneliness\With my words fastening there is no answer or anything else\I can't turn back, never again - goodbye my beloved"

LOST HEAVEN	L'Arc~en~Ciel	"Holding onto our overlapping dreams, towards an endless paradise\Though we haven't even found the things we've lost, we ran through the distant path\And we didn't have a doubt in the world\We'll say goodbye, lost Heaven.\How we longed for Heaven.\We're letting go of something we never had.\Time goes so fast, Heaven is lost.\The dream I reached out for and clutched in my hand is a softly crumbling castle of sand\Just standing still at the fork in the road, pieces of your smile\You disappeared to the paradise you dreamt of\We'll say goodbye, lost Heaven.\How we longed for Heaven.\We're letting go of something we never had.\Time goes so fast, Heaven is lost.\The floating stardust cannot become one, you'll get a red bouquet at the end of this performance\Breaking into a run, even though the sight up ahead is an illusion\We'll say goodbye, lost Heaven.\We'll say goodbye, lost Heaven.\How we longed for Heaven.\We're letting go of something we never had.\Time goes so fast, Heaven!\We'll say goodbye, lost Heaven.\How we longed for Heaven.\We're letting go of something we never had.\Time goes so fast, Heaven is lost.\I wish you good luck.

Of Dust And Nations	Thrice	"The towers that shoulder your pride\The words you've written in stone\Sand will cover them, sand will cover you\The streets that suffer your name\Your very flesh and your bones\Sand will cover them, sand will cover you\\So put your faith in more than steel\Don't store your treasures up with moth and rust, where thieves break in and steal\Pull the fangs from out your heel\We live in but a shadow of the real\\Step out from time\See the dust of nations\Step out from time\Hear the stars' ovation\Saturn will not sleep until the sand has made us clean\Still we stack our stones and bury what we can\But it all will be undone, and nothing built under the sun\Will ever stand before the endless march of sand\\So put your faith in more than steel\Don't store your treasures up, with moth and rust where thieves break in and steal\Pull the fangs from out your heel\We live in but a shadow of the real"

I could never be ashamed of you, no\\I, I will follow you, lay down my life\I would die for you, this very night\\I've never been this cold, the fire's gravity compels!\Like planets cling to sol, I feel my orbit start to fail!\Like moths to flame I come, too close and all my oaths are burned!\As stars begin to run, all my accusers take their turn!\And calling curses down, from my lips lies like poison spill!\And then that awful sound, the sound of prophesy fulfilled!\And then I met your eyes, and I remember everything!\And something in me dies, the night that I betrayed my king!"

GARDEN	DIR EN GREY	" from the day my love began, I began to change\when I was just staring at you\you were always standing in that garden, looking lonely\as you stared at nothing but the scattering flowers\\my unfullfilled wish made another wound in my aching heart\this reality bound up before my eyes still haunts me all the while\so that only the stifling atmosphere will\not forget me now\\GARDEN wishing that someday I'll be able to meet you always\GARDEN in the midst of this passing season, forever... you will...\\the sorrowfully withering flowers that have seen a thousand nights\in sepia your figure pictured\\I want to forget, I don't want to forget, these contradictory feelings\subdued, I stand here all by myself\lonely, with only the snow to colour the scenery, but\still, always, so that I will not forget\\I want to forget, I don't want to forget, these contradictory feelings\subdued, I stand here all by myself\time passes quickly, vanishing from reality, so that I will not forget\these memories"

the clock is already turning to its third cycle
enough already - it's about time you left this room
i'm losing sleep 'caouse as usual you linger around in my head

Take away. Their existence. Take away. Their insistence.

if he arrives, it'll be even worse
before i realize it's too late to stave him off
do you pretend to be the guardian of my dream?
you linger around in my head

Take away. Their existence. Take away. Their insistence.

the night was whisked away; the sun beckons me
their innocent smile drives me to the corner to wake up

Take away. Their existence. Take away. Their insistence.

if i can dive into your skin and gently drown myself
i want to fill into my lungs with you until it pours

the night was whisking away; the sun beckons
stick a gun into them and grasp ypur freedom!

take away

[ I'll wake up the moment you close your eyes
I'll make you watch documentary moveies every single night
The more you try to forget
The more I'll be at your side
I am the vampire who lives in the darkness of your mind
You will not be able to sleep
So why don't you just stay awake...? "

The Cape Of Storms	Hyde	"So where do I sail?\A ship losing control\My cries swallowed up, lost in the raging sea\So where has love gone?\Will I ever reach it?\The Cape of Storms echoes the pain I feel inside\You'll never notice\The colour of sin\Just as the storm clouds close in\It's dark\Here in the shadows\I am pursued\Until the ends of the earth\Embraced\* The ghost ship wanders far\For there is no guiding star\And this treasure has no meaning anymore\# So where do I sail?\A ship losing control\My cries swallowed up, lost in the raging sea\So where has love gone?\Will I ever reach it?\The Cape of Storms echoes the pain I feel inside\You know completely\The taste of sin\Melting sweet in your mouth\Like chocolate\A moment of pleasure\You are fulfilled\But every dream has its time\To die\* The ghost ship wanders far\For there is no guiding star\And this treasure has no meaning anymore\Will this be my fate?\# So where do I sail?\A ship losing control\My cries swallowed up, lost in the raging sea\## So where has love gone?\Will I ever reach it?\The Cape of Storms echoes the pain I feel inside"
SHALLOW SLEEP	Hyde	""
WHITE SONG	Hyde	"Breath\Crisp and cleaning the winter air\I dream of a world in a peaceful sleep\Snow falling gracefully down\Rejoice in winter's deep charm\I can't wait\I can't wait\Freeze\People gather around the fire\I feel all the warmth that the cold inspire\Frost covered tree tops are bright\Shimmering silver tonight\I can't wait\I can't wait\I hope snow will fall upon as soon\Everywhere\The whole world veiled in white\I'd be reset to face the seasons\Once again\Yes on and on falls the snow\Like diamonds from the sky\Our broken hearts-paint them white\Lead us into a wonderland\Pure as the snow-virgin white\A new beginning\And i hope snow will fall upon as soon\Everywhere\The whole world veiled in white\I'd be reset to face the seasons\Once again"
UNEXPECTED	Hyde	"Unexpected\Promises woven\Unexpected\Through space and time the path unwinds\Leading me straight to you\Unexpected\Reaching across a moonlit square\We found each other's hands\Unexpected\Under the blessing of the stars\The life poured into us\To meet is so unexpected"

One Life	The Pillows	"When the petals of a blue poppy\Fluttered even without a breeze\It was because of my sigh\I don't remember, but I'm sure that's right\\Wrapped up in the darkness of day-to-day life\Shackled by freedom\Dazzled by the brilliance\Of dreaming with you\I Stopped being able\To look myself in the face\\There's only one light\That my soiled mirror can reflect\Only one that's not fake\You are my light\\The snail shed his twisted armor\And departed on a journey\He's pelted down by the rain\And gets worn down,\But he won't go back\\I'm spewed forth again\From a mirage that felt like our town\I want to pass it off\As my too-big toes\Getting in my way\\But no matter what shoes I wear\It's my footprints I leave\If I come to a stand still, it's over\That's the sign that I'm ending\\There's only one light\That my soiled mirror can reflect\Only one that's not fake\You are my light\\Those memories I can't touch\Will probably be lost to me someday\Even if nothing recognizable is left\You are my light\\When the petals of a blue poppy\Fluttered even without a breeze\It was because of my sigh\I don't remember,\But I'm sure it's right."

Even though I sometimes lose my way\\Oh good-bye days, right now things inside my heart have begun to change, alright\An uncool kindness is at my side\~With you\\If possible, I'd like to not have sad feelings\But they'll come to me, won't they?\In those times, it would be good, if only I could say\"Yeah, hello! My friend", with a smile\\When we both are humming the same song, I wish for you to be by my side\I'm glad that we were able to meet each other, with such an uncool kindness\\... Good-bye days"

Just drive\Just get us out, dead or alive\The road's too long to mention--\Lord, it's something to see!--\Laid down by the\Good Intentions Paving Company\All the way to the thing\We've been playing at, darling\I can see that you're wearing\Your staying-hat, darling\For the time being, all is well\Won't you love me a spell?\This is blindness beyond all conceiving\While, behind us, the road is leaving\And leaving, and falling back\Like a rope gone slack\Well, I saw straightaway\That the lay was steep\But I fell for you, honey\Easy as falling asleep\And that, right there\Is the course I keep\And no amount of talking\Is going to soften the fall\But, like after the rain\Step out of the overhang. That's all\It had a nice ring to it\When the old opry house rang\So, with a solemn auld lang\Syne, sealed, delivered\I sang\And there is hesitation\And it always remains\(concerning you, me\And the rest of the gang)\And in our quiet hour\I feel I see everything\And am in love\With the hook\Upon which everyone hangs\And I know you meant\To show the extent\To which you gave a goddang--\You ranged real hot and real cold\But I'm sold\I am at home on that range\And I do hate to fold\Right here, at the top of my game\When I've been trying\With my whole heart and soul\To stay right here, in the right lane\But it can make you feel over, and old\(Lord, you know it's a shame)\When I only want for you to pull over\And hold me\Till I can't remember my own name"

The past hasn’t changed.\Loneliness can be endured or it can be enjoyed, enjoy what I have.\The starry night that we looked at together in the past, so many brilliant dreams.\At least memories are forever, like the unchanging starry night, accompanying me.\In the end, there’s only the starry night, like the unchanging memories, accompanying me."

So\GOING NOW!!\\KICK OUT, BREAK OUT\There will be lots and lots of scars\I WON’T GIVE UP – that are a proof of your courage.\And I – who won’t – turn tail and run away will get\such a kick every time as I’m\GOING NOW!!\\So, hold my hands up and award me my belt!"

Heavenly Star	Genki Rockets	"I hear you whispering surrounded in silence\Blue vibration\I hear the waves singing in the distance\Pure isolation\I smile into the distance far away from you\We're in resolution\Dreaming, touching, breathing side by side\Dive into the sky\Let's get away, fly away\I found the path to paradise\Shining spiral of gold\Take my hand, find our way out\Heavenly stars above\Just believe what's in your heart\No border between us!!\I can always feel you inside\Wherever we are\I see you, feel you, I'm your creation\Everlasting affection\Life's an endless spiral going round\Yes! We are in love\Let's get away, fly away\I found the path to paradise\Shining spiral of gold\Take my hand, find our way out\Heavenly stars above\Just believe what's in your heart\No border between us\I can always feel you inside\Wherever we are\Let's get away, fly away\I'm feeling raindrops on my face\Sun shines through the clouds, yeah\Rainbow all around us\I spread my wings, fly away\The wind sweeps me off my feet\Blowing me away, yeah\Trees whispering to me\I'm feeling free now\Let's get away, fly away!!\I found the path to paradise\Shining spiral of gold\Take my hand, find our way out\Heavenly stars above\Just believe what's in your heart\No border between us!!\I can always feel you inside\Wherever we are"

Sayoko	Antares	"\There’s nothing left to take, but I still try to reach\Try to swallow it all down, yet I can’t seem to breathe\Just a single pill of mine, nothing else would suffice\I take it in, now I’m alive\My phone is set on lock and I don’t really care\There’s a tangle and a knot that I cannot repair\I’m a tragedy, I’m ugly, I’m trying to hide\I say “Hello” then wave “Goodbye”\See me fall down\Let me die here, slowly\Nothing goes right\Not a trace of honesty\I’m to blame\So I’ll remain\‘Black’, ‘White’, ‘Day’, ‘Night’\It’s all the same\See it run down\Cut away, no worries\Say no more\I can surely say that I’ve “had enough”\I still refuse to believe\Everyday would be the same\Nothing more, little change\If I cared, it would mean nothing\It’s all such a pain\Friendly bonds are so unneeded\I don’t give a damn\A busy life, is what I am\Could it be, that ‘family’ was a way of escape?\Didn’t know if it was right, so I threw it away\Couldn’t take it anymore, I had taken enough\So then I hid my need for ‘love’\Lay me right down\Let me sleep\I’m restless\Cover my eyes\When I’m up\I’ll finally\Fade away\Here\Today\Give me a reason,\Then I’ll stay\If I could fly\If for only a moment\There wouldn’t be, such a need for casualty\I’m alone, and that is how it’ll be\Why does everything I do cause tragedy?\Why does everyone I know keep leaving me here?\Why do I feel so empty inside?\I only want to die…\See me fall down\Let me die here\Slowly\Nothing goes right\Not a trace of honesty\I’m to blame\So I’ll remain\‘Black’, ‘White’, ‘Day’, ‘Night’\It’s all the same\See it run down,\Cut away, no worries\Say no more\I can surely say that “I’ve had enough”\I can’t remember…\That very day\That very day\Changed me\Happiness died\Like a light\I carried\I’ll sleep tonight\And hope to finally leave..\A world which I don’t believe..\A life which I don’t need..\Now, I’ll finally be free…"
