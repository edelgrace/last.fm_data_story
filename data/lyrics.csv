Movin' on without you	浜崎あゆみ	"Nothing's gonna stop me.\Only you can stop me.\Three o'clock at night...\the cell phone under my pillow...\waiting for it to ring...\don't I look stupid?\The chime of the clock resounds.\Like in a fairy tale,\it won't do even if\the glass high-heels are found.\If giving your attention is a bother,\tell me quickly.\Because, as for me,\I'm not that free.\I'm movin' on without you.\I can no longer\feign ignorance\over your flirty alibis,\because this kind of memories\doesn't belong to the two of us.\Nothing's gonna stop me.\Only you can stop me.\Although it should not have become painful,\why?!\I think it's still too early for me\to play the good and tolerant woman.\Nothing's gonna stop me.\Only you can stop me.\Although your prepared lines\were perfect,\again, you do not call\by four in the morning.\On a night too quiet,\my thoughts flare up you know.\Even though I know the consequences,\I don't get enough sleep in the end.\That kind of promise,\I have already forgotten.\I'm even returning the ring,\so return my heart.\I have to go without you.\Because it is regrettable,\I'll be the one to break up.\Even if I play the good woman,\it's not easy!\Nothing's gonna stop me.\Only you can stop me.\Nothing's gonna stop me.\Only you can stop me.\Nothing's gonna stop me.\Only you can stop me.\Even if you're puzzled, it's ok\I want you to love me.\Even without me saying it,\I want you to understand those things.\Nothing's gonna stop me.\Only you can stop me.\Nothing's gonna stop me.\Only you can stop me.\Nothing's gonna stop me.\Only you can stop me."

Death Of A Strawberry	Dance Gavin Dance	"Sick of being in my head and thinkin about my fate\And worried about my health\Wanna waste away my days with a pretty young thing\And blow through all my wealth\I made some mistakes, not so good with planning\But I got some skills in easy living\Cut my ties with desperation and learned to live with a little sensation\Hey!\Just for the day we’ll pretend I’m made of money\I’ll be your sugar daddy\Hey!\Let’s make a fool of ourselves and crash a party\Act like we own the place\Act like we own the place\Swinging back and forth, all my faults are peaking past the surface\Is it worth it to fall back down?\Please make way for the special invented armor\Mental protection if reality is ragin harder\Hello mister mime, hello medicine\I believe denial makes me hella intelligent\We’re way too caught up in the race with time\It’s getting hard to take it in\We’re tryin hard to be the first in line\Just wanna be a kid again, a kid again\Sick of being in my head and thinkin about my fate\And worried about my health\Wanna waste away my days with a pretty young thing\And blow through all my wealth\I made some mistakes, not so good with planning\But I got some skills in easy living\Cut my ties with desperation and learned to live with a little sensation\Over- Overwhelmed again\Sing out.

Well, shoot 'em up, baby\High as you can go, but I'm the one who's gonna soar.\I burn!\Can't hold me now\You got nothing that can stop me.\I burn!\Swing all you want\Like a fever I will take you down.\It doesn't have to be this way\Let's kiss and make up, then you'll learn\You can fight your life away\I get what I want, so don't bother and just watch me burn.\Hotter than the sun\Feel my fire\Pyromaniac: my desire.\Thought that you could see the truth\'Til I just burned down the booth.\Human Torch can't fuck with me\Johnny Blaze: Suspect B.\Strike 'em quick, lightning fast\Melt them bitches down to ash.\Gasoline, kerosene\Strike the match, ignite the scene.\Things will never be the same\Feel the fury of my flame.\Beg for mercy: it won't help\Embrace the ending you were dealt.\Seems you fucks will never learn\Now sit back and watch me burn.\I burn!\Can't hold me now\You got nothing that can stop me.\I burn!\Swing all you want\Like a fever I will take you down.\I burn!\Can't hold me now\You got nothing that can stop me.\I burn!\Swing all you want\Like a fever I will take you down.\"

The Start of Something	Voxtrot	"This time of night I could call you up\I get angry with athletic ease\Break common laws in twos and threes\If I die clutching your photograph\Don't call me boring, it's just cause I like you\Oh, take me on back, take me on back, and take me back\To the place where I could feel your heart\Is this the end or just the start\Of something really, really beautiful\Wrapped up and disguised as\Something really really ugly?\Won't you...\Come by and see me, I'm a love-letter away\I'd break your name before I'd say:\"I really love you, love you,"\No, I don't care if you saw\I watched every inch of film flash across your Roman features\And I loved it, loved it\No, I don't care if...\You think I'm eager to shut your eyes\Well, I'm sorry everybody knows\You can't break me with your gutter prose\Would you believe it? She sent me a letter\The ring, it nearly weighs her down\She's got another boy, oh boy\Steady your ears, steady your ears and read my lips\Poetry is not a luxury, it's how I break this home\And when I'm really ill, won't you cradle me?\Man is not a noble animal, but maybe woman is\Remember, I heard you...\Inside your room you said:\You'd never really live until your back's against the wall\Oh did you really mean it?\No, I never break my gaze, if just to see the scar\Remain reflected in your eyes\I think it's time to go home\Oh, tell me your thoughts\Tell me your thoughts on liberty\See there's a place where I sink to sleeping\She said:\"Oh, my vote is as red as my blood,"\Will you join me for another round?\I haven't had the chance to speak yet\Godspeed...\I break the law once every week to feel your touch\Oh, what's a book to you in bed?\Do you feel better? Older?\Say this just makes me ill\Your name is dripping from my pen\Still, you're not around to curse\I've gotta drop the gun now\Say I'm still under you\Marianne, let the ghosts sleep tonight\Marianne, let the ghosts sleep\Just shut your eyes and burn the past\Marianne, let the ghosts sleep tonight\Marianne, let the ghosts sleep\Just shut your eyes and burn the past\Marianne, let the ghosts sleep tonight\Marianne, let the ghosts sleep\Just shut your eyes and burn the past\Marianne, let the ghosts sleep tonight\Marianne, let the ghosts sleep\Just shut your eyes and burn the past"

This Is How I Disappear	My Chemical Romance	"Go!\To un-explain the unforgivable\Drain all the blood and give the kids a show\By streetlight this dark night\A séance down below\There's things that I have done\You never should ever know\And without you is how I disappear\And live my life alone forever now\And without you is how I disappear\And live my life alone forever now\Who walks among the famous living dead\Drowns all the boys and girls inside your bed\And if you could talk to me\Tell me if it's so\That all the good girls go to heaven\Well, heaven knows\That without you is how I disappear\And live my life alone forever now\And without you is how I disappear\And live my life alone forever now\Can you hear me cry out to you?\Words I thought I'd choke on, figure out\I'm really not so with you anymore\I'm just a ghost\So I can't hurt you anymore\So I can't hurt you anymore\And now, you wanna see how far down I can sink?\Let me go, fuck!\So you can\Well, now, so you can\I'm so far away from you\Well, now, so you can\And without you is how I disappear\And without you is how I disappear\Forever, forever now"

Red Sky	Thrice	"I know what lies beneath\I've seen the flash of teeth\Conspiring with the reef\To sink our ship\The wind's a cheating wife\Her tongue a thirsty knife\And she could take your life\With one good kiss\Can you see the sky turn red\As morning's light breaks over me?\Know tonight we'll make our bed\At the bottom of the sea\I know the ocean speaks\I've heard her call to me\And smiling in my dreams\She whispers this:\("The stars retreat behind their veil\The clouds are clinging to your sail\The storm is coming, can you see?")\Can you see the sky turn red\As morning's light breaks over me?\Know tonight we'll make our bed\At the bottom of the sea\Look and see the sky turn red\Like blood it covers over me\And soon the sea shall give up her dead\We'll raise an empire from the bottom of the sea"

E Is For Estranged	Owen Pallett	"I think that 80% of a good show is rooted in humiliation\Boys run like water from the barrel to the trough\They'll never stop their running\Gunning for their brothers\This house is a hostel\It is peaceful, but it's always emptying\Boys all want to be someone\Haven't you heard? I am a flightless bird\I am a liar, feeding facts to a false fire\If pathos is borne, borne out of bullshit\In formal attire, I'll score you a string ensemble\I saw my son at seventeen\The shutters made projections on his naked frame\And now at twenty-five\He simply cannot stay away from the ketamine\With makeup on his sores\He spends an hour a day composing little eulogies\Sometimes he sends me letters\But they're mostly garbled phrases and apologies\But haven't you heard? I am a flightless bird\I am a liar, feeding facts to a false fire\If pathos is borne, borne out of bullshit\In formal attire, cue the Bulgarian men's choir"
Alone in the dark	COMEBACK MY DAUGHTERS	
Emily	Joanna Newsom	"The meadowlark and the chim-choo-ree and the sparrow\Set to the sky in a flying spree, for the sport of the pharaoh\Little while later the Pharisees dragged a comb through the meadow\Do you remember what they called up to you and me, in our window?\There is a rusty light on the pines tonight\Sun pouring wine, lord, or marrow\Down into the bones of the birches\And the spires of the churches\Jutting out from the shadows\The yoke, and the axe, and the old smokestacks and the bale and the barrow\And everything sloped like it was dragged from a rope\In the mouth of the south below\We've seen those mountains kneeling, felten and grey\We thought our very hearts would up and melt away\From that snow in the nighttime\Just going\And going\And the stirring of wind chimes\In the morning\In the morning\Helps me find my way back in\From the place where I have been\And, Emily - I saw you last night by the river\I dreamed you were skipping little stones across the surface of the water\Frowning at the angle where they were lost, and slipped under forever\In a mud-cloud, mica-spangled, like the sky'd been breathing on a mirror\Anyhow - I sat by your side, by the water\You taught me the names of the stars overhead that I wrote down in my ledger\Though all I knew of the rote universe were those Pleiades loosed in December\I promised you I'd set them to verse so I'd always remember\That the meteorite is a source of the light\And the meteor's just what we see\And the meteoroid is a stone that's devoid of the fire that propelled it to thee\And the meteorite’s just what causes the light\And the meteor’s how it’s perceived\And the meteoroid’s a bone thrown from the void\That lies quiet and offering to thee\You came and lay a cold compress upon the mess I'm in\Threw the window wide and cried, "Amen! Amen! Amen!"\The whole world stopped to hear you hollering\You looked down and saw now what was happening\The lines are fading in my kingdom\(Though I have never known the way to border them in)\So the muddy mouths of baboons and sows and the grouse and the horse and the hen\Grope at the gate of the looming lake that was once a tidy pen\And the mail is late and the great estates are not lit from within\The talk in town's becoming downright sickening\In due time we will see the far buttes lit by a flare\I've seen your bravery, and I will follow you there\And row through the nighttime\Gone healthy\Gone healthy all of a sudden\In search of the midwife\Who could help me\Who could help me\Help me find my way back in\There are worries where I've been\Say, say, say in the lee of the bay; don't be bothered\Leave your troubles here where the tugboats shear the water from the water\(Flanked by furrows, curling back, like a match held up to a newspaper)\Emily, they'll follow your lead by the letter\And I make this claim, and I'm not ashamed to say I know you better\What they've seen is just a beam of your sun that banishes winter\Let us go! Though we know it's a hopeless endeavor\The ties that bind, they are barbed and spined and hold us close forever\Though there is nothing would help me come to grips with a sky that is gaping and yawning\There is a song I woke with on my lips as you sailed your great ship towards the morning\Come on home, the poppies are all grown knee-deep by now\Blossoms all have fallen, and the pollen ruins the plow\Peonies nod in the breeze and while they wetly bow\With hydrocephalitic listlessness ants mop up-a their brow\And everything with wings is restless, aimless, drunk and dour\The butterflies and birds collide at hot, ungodly hours\And my clay-colored motherlessness rangily reclines\Come on home, now! All my bones are dolorous with vines\Pa pointed out to me, for the hundredth time tonight\The way the ladle leads to a dirt-red bullet of light\Squint skyward and listen\Loving him, we move within his borders\Just asterisms in the stars' set order\We could stand for a century\Staring\With our heads cocked\In the broad daylight at this thing\Joy\Landlocked\In bodies that don't keep\Dumbstruck with the sweetness of being\Until we don't be told\Take this\Eat this\Told"
Oblivius	The Strokes	"Unchain me\It's not my midnight yet\Act like a fox but think like a sheep (Wall Street)\Unchain me\Cause this is my bank’s advice\We’re gonna give it back to you\Some other day\Take off from the runway\Thinking of a sad day\Racing down the highway\Looking at me sideways\What side are you standing on?\What side you standing on?\What side are you standing on?\What side you standing on?\Unchain me\It’s time\I know the way uptown\Unchain me\I've waited for the time\Get you with your pyjamas on\Take off from the runway\Thinking of a sad day\Playing with his new toys\Looking at the sad boys\What side are you standing on?\What side you standing on?\What side are you standing on?\What side you standing on?\And we take\What we like from them\And then say\“What do you want from me?”\Don’t wait so long\Way too long\They wait too long\I can’t stay awake too long\You never wait for some\Other generation\I’ll wait somewhere\Alone\Get it in your head, get out of (my way)\What side are you standing on?\What side you standing on?\What side are you standing on?\What side you standing on?\What side you standing on?\What side you standing on?\Ohhhh"

Between The End And Where We Lie	Thrice	"Is this everything, I've dreamed of so much more, between the end and where we lie\Here all hopes and dreams are scavenged from the floor and fed into machines that feed on vacant eyes\All of my dreams, always find me far beyond these fake fluorescent skies\I know there must be something more, if I could only find the door, then I could free myself and see the world outside\Where Daylight breaks on you and shines into the grey that sleeps beneath your skull\Daylight breaks on you and burns away the grey that suffocates your soul\For now I hold a key, and though I may be lost, I know that I will find my way\I search endlessly but every time I've thought that I was near, the smoke and mirrors lead me astray\See the pit boss, steal each tick tock, time it seems will suffer at our hands\I look for exits in the haze, the dense electric twilit maze, I've heard that there is one that leads to sunlit lands where\Daylight, they tell me that it's just a myth\Daylight, they tell me that it can't exist\They try to betray me with a kiss\They might never know just what they've missed as\Daylight pours fire into my gray eyes\Pour grace into my gray life\Breaks in and lights the way\I can't live without the day"

Only Skin	Joanna Newsom	"And there was a booming above you\That night black airplanes flew over the sea\And they were lowing and shifting like\Beached whales\Shelled snails\As you strained and you squinted to see\The retreat of their hairless and blind cavalry\You froze in your sand shoal\Prayed for your poor soul;\Sky seemed a bread roll, soaking in a milk-bowl\And when the bread broke —\Fell in bricks of wet smoke —\My sleeping heart woke, and my waking heart spoke\Then there was a silence you took to mean something:\Mean, Run, sing\For alive you will evermore be\And the plague of the greasy black engines a-skulking\Has gone east\While you’re left to explain them to me —\Released\From their hairless and blind cavalry\With your hands in your pockets\Stubbily running\To where I’m unfresh\Undressed and yawning —\Well, what is this craziness?\This crazy talking?\You caught some small death\When you were sleepwalking\It was a dark dream, darlin;\It’s over\The firebreather is beneath the clover\Beneath his breathing there is cold clay, forever:\A toothless hound-dog choking on a feather\But I took my fishing pole (fearing your fever)\Down to the swimming hole, where there grows a bitter herb\That blooms but one day a year, by the riverside —\I’d bring it here:\Apply it gently\To the love you’ve lent me\While the river was twisting and braiding, the bait bobbed\And the string sobbed\As it cut through the hustling breeze\And I watched how the water was kneading so neatly\Gone treacly\Nearly slowed to a stop in this heat;\Frenzy coiling flush along the muscles beneath\Press on me\We are restless things\Webs of seaweed are swaddling\You call upon the dusk of the\Musk of a squid:\Shot full of ink, until you sink into your crib\Rowing along, among the reeds, among the rushes\I heard your song, before my heart had time to hush it!\Smell of a stonefruit being cut and being opened\Smell of a low and of a lazy cinder smoking\And when the fire moves away\Fire moves away, son\Why would you say\I was the last one?\Scrape your knee: it is only skin\Makes the sound of violins\When I cut your hair, and leave the birds all the trimmings\I am the happiest woman among all women\And the shallow water stretches as far as I can see\Knee deep, trudging along —\The seagull weeps ‘so long’ —\I’m humming a threshing song —\Until the night is over, hold on\Hold on;\Hold your horses back from the fickle dawn\I have got some business out at the edge of town\Candy weighing both of my pockets down\Till I can hardly stay afloat, from the weight of them\(and knowing how the commonfolk condemn\What it is I do, to you, to keep you warm:\Being a woman. Being a woman.)\But always up the mountainside you’re clambering\Groping blindly, hungry for anything;\Picking through your pocket linings —\Well, what is this?\Scrap of sassafras, eh Sisyphus?\I see the blossoms broke and wet after the rain\Little sister, he will be back again\I have washed a thousand spiders down the drain\Spiders’ ghosts hang, soaked and dangling\Silently from all the blooming cherry trees\In tiny nooses, safe from everyone —\Nothing but a nuisance; gone now, dead and done —\Be a woman. Be a woman\Though we felt the spray of the waves\We decided to stay, 'till the tide rose too far\We weren’t afraid, cause we know what you are;\And you know that we know what you are\Awful atoll —\O, incalculable indiscreetness and sorrow!\Bawl bellow:\Sibyl sea-cow, all done up in a bow\Toddle and roll;\Teethe an impalpable bit of leather\While yarrow, heather and hollyhock\Awkwardly molt along the shore\Are you mine?\My heart?\Mine anymore?\Stay with me for awhile\That’s an awfully real gun\I know life will lay you down\As the lightning has lately done\Failing this, failing this\Follow me, my sweetest friend\To see what you anointed\In pointing your gun there\Lay it down! Nice and slow!\There is nowhere to go\Save up;\Up where the light, undiluted, is\Weaving, in a drunk dream\At the sight of my baby, out back:\Back on the patio\Watching the bats bring night in\— while, elsewhere\Estuaries of wax-white\Wend, endlessly, towards seashores unmapped\*\Last week, our picture window\Produced a half-word\Heavy and hollow\Hit by a brown bird\We stood and watched her gape like a rattlesnake\And pant and labor over every intake\I said a sort of prayer for some rare grace\Then thought I ought to take her to a higher place\Said, “dog nor vulture nor cat shall toy with you\And though you die, bird, you will have a fine view.”\Then in my hot hand, she slumped her sick weight\We tramped through the poison oak, heartbroke and inchoate\The dogs were snapping, so you cuffed their collars\While I climbed the tree-house. Then how I hollered!\Cause she’d lain, as still as a stone, in my palm, for a lifetime or two;\Then saw the treetops, cocked her head, and up and flew\(While back in the world that moves, often, according to\The hoarding of these clues\Dogs still run roughly around\Little tufts of finch-down\The cities we passed were a flickering wasteland,\But his hand, in my hand, made them hale and harmless\While down in the lowlands, the crops are all coming;\We have everything\Life is thundering blissful towards death\In a stampede\Of his fumbling green gentleness\You stopped by;\I was all alive\In my doorway, we shucked and jived\And when you wept, I was gone;\See, I got gone when I got wise\But I can’t with certainty say we survived\Then down and down\And down and down\And down and deeper\Stoke, without sound\The blameless flames\You endless sleeper\Through fire below\And fire above\And fire within\Sleep through the things that couldn’t have been\If you hadn’t have been\And when the fire moves away\Fire moves away, son\Why would you say\I was the last one?\All my bones, they are gone, gone, gone\Take my bones, I don’t need none\Cold, cold cupboard, lord, nothing to chew on!\Suck all day on a cherry stone\Dig a little hole not three inches round —\Spit your pit in a hole in the ground\Weep upon the spot for the starving of me!\Till up grows a fine young cherry tree\When the bough breaks, what’ll you make for me?\A little willow cabin to rest on your knee\What’ll I do with a trinket such as this?\Think of your woman, who’s gone to the west\But I’m starving and freezing in my measly old bed!\Then I’ll crawl across the salt flats, to stroke your sweet head\Come across the desert with no shoes on!\I love you truly\Or I love no-one\Fire moves away. Fire moves away, son\Why would you say that I was the last one, last one?\Clear the room! There’s a fire, a fire, a fire\Get going\And I’m going to be right behind you\And if the love of a woman or two, dear\Couldn't move you to such heights\Then all I can do\Is do, my darling, right by you"

Monkey & Bear	Joanna Newsom	"Down in the green hay\Where monkey and bear usually lay\They woke from a stable-boy’s cry\He said: “someone come quick —\The horses got loose, got grass-sick —\They’ll founder! Fain, they’ll die.”\What is now known by the sorrel and the roan?\By the chestnut, and the bay, and the gelding grey?\It is: stay by the gate you are given\Remain in your place, for your season\O, had the overfed dead but listened\To that high-fence, horse-sense, wisdom…\But\“Did you hear that, Bear?” said\Monkey, “we’ll get out of here, fair and square\They've left the gate open wide!\“So, my bride\“Here is my hand. Where is your paw?\Try and understand my plan, Ursula\My heart is a furnace\Full of love that is just, and earnest\Now\We know that we must unlearn this\Allegiance to a life of service\And no longer answer to that heartless\Hay-monger, nor be his accomplice —\(that charlatan, with artless hustling!)\But Ursula, we’ve got to eat something\And earn our keep, while still within\The borders of the land that man has girded\(all double-bolted and tightfisted!)\Until we reach the open country\A-steeped in milk and honey\Will you keep your fancy clothes on, for me?\Can you bear a little longer to wear that leash?\“My love, I swear by the air I breathe:\Sooner or later, you’ll bare your teeth\“But for now, just dance, darling\C’mon, will you dance, my darling?\Darling, there’s a place for us;\Can we go, before I turn to dust?\Darling there’s a place for us\“Darling. C'mon will you dance\My darling?\The hills are groaning with excess\Like a table ceaselessly being set\C'mon, will you dance, my darling?\And we’ll get there yet.”\They trooped past the guards\Past the coops, and the fields, and the\Farmyards, all night, till finally\The space they gained\Grew much farther than\The stone that Bear threw\To mark where they’d stop for tea\But\“Walk a little faster\Don’t look backwards —\“your feast is to the East, which lies a little past the pasture\“When the blackbirds hear tea whistling they rise and clap\Their applause caws the kettle black\And we can’t have none of that!\Move along, Bear; there, there; that’s that.”\(Though cast in plaster\Our Ursala’s heart beat faster\Than monkey’s ever will.)\But still\They have got to pay the bills\Hadn’t they?\That is what the monkey would say\So, with the courage of a clown, or a cur\Or a kite, jerking tight at its tether\In her dun-brown gown of fur\And her jerkin of\Swansdown and leather\Bear would sway on her hind legs;\The organ would grind dregs of song\For the pleasure\Of the children who’d shriek\Throwing coins at her feet\Then recoiling in terror\Sing, “dance, darling\C'mon, will you dance, my darling?\Darling, there’s a place for us;\Can we go, before I turn to dust?\Darling there’s a place for us\“Darling\C'mon, will you dance, my darling?\Keep your eyes fixed on the highest hill\Where you’ll ever-after eat your fill\O darling…dear…mine…if you dance\Darling: I will love you still.”\Deep in the night\Shone a weak and miserly light\Where the monkey shouldered his lamp\Someone had told him the\Bear'd been wandering a fair piece away\From where they were camped\Someone had told him\The bear had been sneaking away\To the seaside caverns, to bathe;\And the thought troubled the monkey\For he was afraid of spelunking\Down in those caves\And also afraid what the\Village people would say\If they saw the bear in that state —\Lolling and splashing obscenely\Well, it seemed irrational, really\Washing that face;\Washing that matted and flea-bit pelt\In some sea-spit-shine —\Old kelp dripping with brine\But monkey just laughed, and he muttered\“When she comes back, Ursula will be bursting with pride —\Till I jump up!\Saying, ‘You've been rolling in muck!\Saying, ‘You smell of garbage and grime!’”\But far out\Far out\By now\By now —\Far out, by now, Bear ploughed\Because she would\Not drown:\First the outside-legs of the bear\Up and fell down, in the water, like knobby garters\Then the outside-arms of the bear\Fell off, as easy as if sloughed\From boiled tomatoes\Low’red in a genteel curtsy\Bear shed the mantle of her\Diluvian shoulders;\And, with a sigh\She allowed the burden of belly to drop\Like an apron full of boulders\If you could hold up her\Threadbare coat to the light\Where it’s worn translucent in places\You’d see spots where\Almost every night of the year\Bear had been mending\Suspending that baseness\Now her coat drags through the water\Bagging, with a life’s-worth of hunger\Limitless minnows;\In the magnetic embrace\Balletic and glacial\Of bear’s insatiable shadow —\Left there!\Left there!\When bear\Left bear;\Left there\Left there\When bear\Stepped clear of bear\(Sooner or later you'll bury your teeth)"

Out of the Blue	Julian Casablancas	"Somewhere along the way\My hopefulness turned to sadness\Somewhere along the way\My sadness turned to bitterness\Somewhere along the way\My bitterness turned to anger\Somewhere along the way\My anger turned to vengeance\And the ones that I make pay were never the ones who deserve it\And the ones who deserve it, they'll never understand it\Yes, I know I'm going to hell in a purple basket\'least I'll be in another world while you're pissing on my casket....\How could you be\(oh-oh-ohh)\So perfect for me\(oh-oh-ohh)\Why can't you ignore\(oh-oh-ohh)\The things I did before\(oh-oh-ohh)\Somewhere along the way\Exacting vengence gave excitement\Somewhere along the way\That excitement turned to pleasure\Somewhere along the way\That pleasure turned to madness\But sooner or later that kind of madness turns into pain\And the ones that I made pay were never the ones who deserved it\Those who helped me along the way, I smacked 'em as I thanked 'em\Yes, I know I'm going to hell in a leather jacket\'least I'll be in another world while you're pissing on my casket\All that I can do is sing a song of faded glory\And all you got to do is sit there, look pretty, and make 'em horny\Together we'll sing songs and tell exaggerated stories\About the way we feel today and tonight and in the morning...\How could you be\(oh-oh-ohh)\So perfect for me\(oh-oh-ohh)\Why can't you ignore\(oh-oh-ohh)\The things I did before\(oh-oh-ohh)\Take all your fears\Pretend they're all true\Take all your plans\Pretend they fell through\That's what it's like...\(oh-oh-ohh)\That's what it's like for most people in this world\The rich or the poor\(oh-oh-ohh)\Muslims or Jews\(oh-oh-ohh)\When roles are reversed\(oh-oh-ohh)\Opinions are too...\(oh-oh-oh)\That's all I'm gonna say now\Before they come knocking on my door\(oh oh ohh)"

Occident	Joanna Newsom	"Mercy me, the night is long\Take my pen to write you this song\Lord is it harder to carry on\Or to know when you are done?\All my life I felt as though\I'm inside a beautiful\Memory replaying with the sound turned\Down low\Long life, show your face\Slow heart, curb your taste\Smoke me out of my hiding place\Long life, state your case\What in the world are we waiting for?\Building glowing cities along the shore\Where the wind batters in\Baiting my kin like a matador\So much value placed upon\What lies just beyond our plans\Waving my handkerchief\Running along to the end of the sand\Long life, speak your name\So tired of the guessing game\But something is moving just out of frame\Slow heart, brace and aim\Breaching slowly across the sea\One mast - flash like the stinger of a bee\To take you away\A swarming fleet is gonna take you from me\The universe is getting loose\Sodden spread from some leaden disuse\Rushing unhinged towards diminishing lights\Like a headless caboose\I will wait for you 'longside the ocean\And make do with my no-skin\But then long life, will you let me in?\And then slow heart, are you going to know him?\Long life, speak your name\I wait while I decry the wait\And when I die, may I relate\Slow heart, congregate\To leave your home and your family\For some distortion of property?\Well darling I can't go\But you may stay\Here with me"
In California	Joanna Newsom	"My heart became a drunken runt\On the day I sunk in this shunt\To tap me clean\Of all the wonder\And the sorrow I have seen\Since I left my home:\My home, on the old Milk Lake\Where the darkness does fall so fast\It feels like some kind of mistake\(just like they told you it would;\Just like the Tulgeywood)\When I came into my land\I did not understand:\Neither dry rot, nor the burn pile\Nor the bark-beetle, nor the dry well\Nor the black bear\But there is another\Who is a little older\When I broke my bone\He carried me up from the riverside\To spend my life\In spitting-distance\Of the love that I have known\I must stay here, in an endless eventide\And if you come and see me\You will upset the order\You cannot come and see me\For I set myself apart\But when you come and see me\In California\You cross the border of my heart\Well, I have sown untidy furrows\Across my soul\But I am still a coward\Content to see my garden grow\So sweet & full\Of someone else's flowers\But sometimes\I can almost feel the power\Sometimes I am so in love with you\(Like a little clock\That trembles on the edge of the hour\Only ever calling out "Cuckoo, cuckoo")\When I called you\You, little one\In a bad way\Did you love me?\Do you spite me?\Time will tell if I can be well\And rise to meet you rightly\While, moving across my land\Brandishing themselves\Like a burning branch\Advance the tallow-colored\Walleyed deer\Quiet as gondoliers\While I wait all night, for you\In California\Watching the fox pick off my goldfish\From their sorry, golden state--\And I am no longer\Afraid of anything, save\The life that, here, awaits\I don't belong to anyone\My heart is heavy as an oil drum\And I don't want to be alone\My heart is yellow as an ear of corn\And I have torn my soul apart, from\Pulling artlessly with fool commands\Some nights\I just never go to sleep at all\And I stand\Shaking in my doorway like a sentinel\All alone\Bracing like the bow upon a ship\And fully abandoning\Any thought of anywhere\But home\My home\Sometimes I can almost feel the power\And I do love you\Is it only timing\That has made it such a dark hour\Only ever chiming out\"Cuckoo, cuckoo"?\My heart, I wear you down, I know\Gotta think straight\Keep a clean plate;\Keep from wearing down\If I lose my head\Just where am I going to lay it?\(For it has half-ruined me\To be hanging around\Here, among the daphne\Blooming out of the big brown;\I am native to it, but I'm overgrown\I have choked my roots\On the earth, as rich as roe\Here\Down in California.)"

Elf's Lament	Barenaked Ladies	"I'm a man of reason, and they say "'Tis the season to be jolly"\But it's folly when you volley for position\Never in existence has there been such a resistance\To ideas meant to free us\If you could see us, then you'd listen\Toiling through the ages, making toys on garnished wages\There's no union\We're only through when we outdo the competition\I make toys, but I've got aspirations\Make some noise\Use your imagination\Girls and boys, before you wish for what you wish for\There's a list for who's been\Naughty or nice, but consider the price to an elf\A full indentured servitude can reflect on one's attitude\But that silly red hat just makes the fat man look outrageous\Absurd though it may seem, you know, I've heard there's even been illegal doping\And though we're coping, I just hope it's not contagious\You try to start a movement, and you think you see improvement\But when thrown into the moment, we just don't seem so courageous\I make toys, but I've got aspirations\Make some noise\Use your imagination\Girls and boys, before you wish for what you wish for\There's a list for who's been\Naughty or nice, but consider the price to an elf\You look at yourself\You're an elf\And the shelf is just filled with disappointing memories\Trends come and go, and your friends wanna know why you aren't just happy making crappy little gizmos\Every kid knows they'll just throw this stuff away\We're used to repetition, so we drew up a petition\We, the undersigned, feel undermined\Let's redefine "employment"\We know that we've got leverage, so we'll hand the fat man a beverage\And sit back while we attack the utter lack of our enjoyment\It may be tough to swallow, but our threats are far from hollow\He may thunder, but if he blunders, he may wonder where the toys went\I make toys, but I've got aspirations\Make some noise\Use your imagination\Girls and boys, before you wish for what you wish for\There's a list for who's been\Naughty or nice, but consider the price\Naughty or nice, but consider the price\Naughty or nice, but consider the price to an elf"

(눈물만 새)\웃으면 안 돼? 난 왜?\사람 싫어하는데 무슨 이유가 있냐고?\내가 싫을 땐 왜 수천 수만가지냐고\전부 내 탓이라고 소리치네\내 입을 막는 goalkeepers, 꼴보기 싫대!\다 나만 싫어해\다 나만 미워해\다 손가락질 해\네가 없으면 나 미칠 것 같애\나란 쥐구멍에 비친 단 하나의 볕\슬픔 나누고는 싶지만, 다 나의 것\넌 그냥 웃어주기만 하고 숨어\세상 가장 큰 방패 뒤에 머물러 행복만 품어\이런 비호감, 공공의 적인 나와...\숨만 쉬면 논란, 공공의 껌인 나와\도마 위에서 춤을 추며 즐기는 너\취향 하나 참 죽이는 너\다 나만 뭐라 해\화살로 겨냥해\사라지길 바래\네가 없으면 나 죽을 것 같애\"제가 그렇게 미워요?"\"저를 사랑해줘요"\날 사랑한다. 날 미워한다\날 사랑한다. 날 미워한다\날 사랑한다. 날 미워한다\Love and hate! 둘 다 고맙지, 뭐\Hate me.

À cause de l'automne	Alizée	"Quand les feuilles tombent dans les rues sombres sur nos pas\Et quand en pleins jours tout tourne cours et tout s’éteint\Tout va trop vite, le dernier amour en fuite\À cause de l’automne, je te quitte\Vivre en aquarium me rend triste\Si je fuis, c’est à cause de l’automne, de l’automne\Les couleurs s’effacent et nous pardonnent\Les amours se lassent et abandonnent\À cause, à cause de l’automne\Je, je n’aime plus par la fenêtre, voir ces deux êtres\Si je vagabonde dans la pénombre tout comme Verlaine\Tout va trop vite, le dernier amour en fuite\À cause de l’automne, je te quitte\S’il te plaît pardonne, je fais vite\Si je fuis, c’est à cause de l’automne, de l'automne\Si nous cachons nos corps sous des tonnes\De mensonges et de tords c'est en somme\À cause, à cause de l’automne\À cause de l’automne\Tout va trop vite, le dernier amour en fuite\À cause de l’automne je te quitte\S’il te plaît pardonne, je fais vite\Si je fuis, c’est à cause de l’automne, de l'automne\Si nous cachons nos corps sous des tonnes\De mensonges et de tords c'est en somme\À cause, à cause de l’automne\À cause de l’automne, je te quitte\Vivre en aquarium me rend triste\Si je fuis, c’est à cause de l’automne, de l’automne\Les couleurs s’effacent et nous pardonnent\Les amours se lassent et abandonnent\À cause, à cause de l’automne"
The Devil in I	Slipknot	"Undo these chains, my friend, I'll show you the rage I've hidden\Perish the sacrament, swallow but nothing's forgiven\You and I can't decide which of us was taken for granted\Make amends, some of us are destined to be outlived\Step inside, see the Devil in I!\Too many times we've let it come to this\Step inside, see the Devil in I!\You'll realize I'm not your Devil anymore\Under the words of men, something is tempting the father\Where is your will, my friend? Insatiates never even bother\You and I, wrong or right, traded a lie for the leverage\In between the lens in light, you're not what you seem\Step inside, see the Devil in I!\Too many times we've let it come to this\Step inside, see the Devil in I!\You'll realize I'm not your Devil!\I'm not your Devil anymore!\Your station is abandoned!\Fooled you 'cause I know what you've done!\Sensation, deprivation!\You should've burned when you turned on everyone!\So step inside, see the Devil in I!\Too many times we've let it come to this\Step inside, see the Devil in I!\I know you'll find your answers in the end\Step inside, see the Devil in I!\You'll realize I'm not your Devil anymore\So step inside!\Step inside!\See the devil in I!\See the devil in I!"

Soft as Chalk	Joanna Newsom	"So so long ago and so far away\When time was just a line that you fed me when you wanted to stay\We'd talk as soft as chalk till morning came, pale as a pearl\No time, no, no time, now I have got all the time in the world\Say, honey, did you belong to me?\Tell me honey, was your heart at rest\When, darlin, all the mourning doves were howling us\A song of love's oh godawful lawlessness?\Lawlessness\Say, honey, did you belong to me\Tell me honey, did I pass your test\I lay as still as death until the dawn\Whereupon I wrested from y'r godawful lawlessness\Lawlessness\I roam around the tidy grounds of my dappled sanatorium\Coatless I sit amongst the motes adrift and I dote upon my pinesap gum\And the light through the pines in brassy tines lays over me, dim as rum\And thick as molasses, and so time passes\And so, my heart, tomorrow comes\I feel you leaning out back with the crickets\Loyal heart marking the soon-ness, darkness tonight\Still, the mourning doves will summon us their song\Of love's neverdoneing lawlessness\Lawlessness\While over and over: rear up, stand down, lay round\Trying to sound out or guess the reasons\I sleep like a soldier -- without rest\But there is no treason where there is only lawlessness\Lawlessness\In the last week of the last year I was aware\I took a blind shot across the creek at the black bear\When he roused me in the night and left me cowering with my light calling out\Who is there?\Who's there?\Who is there?\I watched you sleep repeating my prayer\You give love a little shove and it becomes terror, and now I am\Calling in a sadness beyond anger and beyond fear\Who is there?\Who's there?\Who is there?\I glare and nod like the character God bearing down upon the houses and lawns\I knew a little bit, but darling, you were it, and darling, now it is long gone\Sweetheart in your clean bright start back there behind a hill and a dell\And a state line or two I'll be thinking of you, yes, I'll be thinking and be wishing you well\We land, I stand, but I wait for the sound of the bell\I have to catch a cab and my bags are at the carousel\And then, Lord, just then, time alone will only tell\You mourning dove"

Where are you, Gloria?\Don't lose you faith to your lost naivety\Weather the storm and don't look back on last November\When your banners were burning down\Gloria! Viva la Gloria!\Send me your amnesty down to the broken hearted\Bring us the season that we always will remember\Don't let the bonfires go out!\So, Gloria, send out your message of\The light that shadows in the night\Gloria, where's your undying love?\Tell me the story of your life\Your life!"

The Window	Thrice	"All that I've known's within the walls of this room\Where there's a window, roughly boarded up\It's true the gaps are patched, but even through the tiny cracks\I feel a wind blow, I see a light of strangest hue\And there's nothing I can say - there's no way I can prove\That there's a place beyond this room\But still, there's something in the way the light comes shining through\And in the way the curtains move\Late in the night I lay awake, my eyes fixed\On the window, I strained my ears until\I thought that I might have heard a song, somehow hiding\In the soft glow, old as time and ever new\There's nothing I can say - there's no way I can prove\That there's a place beyond this room\But still, there's something in the way the light comes shining through\And in the way the curtains move\I found a note scratched in the wall\In a pained and earnest scrawl\The hand, I recognized, was somehow mine ...\I read each line with dread:\"There's no wind and there's no light\There's no song you hear at night\There's nowhere to hide, be terrified\It's all inside your head"\But still there's something in the way\The light comes shining through\And in the way - in the way the curtains move"

proof of the blood	exist†trace	"信じるモノなんてもう 何一つ残っていないから\繰り返されるこの裏切りと 離れない That language ...\ただ一人闇に残されて 瓦礫の上を裸足で\泥にまみれ血を流し 歩き続け It's still .... all the time\The believed relation breakes cruely and doesn't restore\破片は無数にこの心を It tears apart scatteringly\Nothing is felt in relation of blood. It's meaningless\もう二度とお前には doesn't expectation\醜く汚れたこの姿 それでも進み続けるだろう\無様にもがくこのオレを 好きなだけ笑えばいい\In the inside of darkness and dispair even if it can't move\この意識は流れ続け It will be led to that place\Since blood is seen continue flowing and feels easy\深い痛み抱えたまま It is stronger than anything\潰れたこの両手で変わらぬ誓い抱き続けて\黒く果てしないこの道に血の跡を残してゆく\微かに見える闇の果て求め 全てを捧げて必ず It surely arrives"

Thank You for the Venom	My Chemical Romance	"Sister, I'm not much a poet, but a criminal\And you never had a chance\Love it, or leave it, you can't understand\A pretty face, but you do so carry on\And on, and on, and on\I wouldn't front the scene if you paid me\I'm just the way that the doctor made me, on\And on, and on, and on\Love is the red the rose on your coffin door\What's life like, bleeding on the floor\The floor, the floor, the floor\You'll never make me leave\I wear this on my sleeve\Give me a reason to believe\So give me all your poison\And give me all your pills\And give me all your hopeless hearts\And make me ill\You're running after something\That you'll never kill\If this is what you want\Then fire at will\Preach all you want but who's going to save me\I keep a gun on the book you gave me, hallelujah, lock and load\Black is the kiss, the touch of the serpent son\It ain't the mark or the scar that makes you one\And run, and run, and run\You'll never make me leave\I wear this on my sleeve\Give me a reason to believe\So give me all your poison\And give me all your pills\And give me all your hopeless hearts\And make me ill\You're running after something\That you'll never kill\If this is what you want\Then fire at will\You want to follow something\Give me a better cause to lead\Just give me what I need\You'll never make me leave\I wear this on my sleeve\Give me a reason to believe\So give me all your poison\And give me all your pills\And give me all your hopeless hearts\And make me ill\You're running after something\That you'll never kill\If this is what you want\Then fire at will"

Fuck Me Pumps	Amy Winehouse	"When you walk in the bar\And you’re dressed like a star\Rocking your F-Me-Pumps\And a man notice you\With your Gucci bag crew\Can’t tell who he’s looking to\Cause you all look the same\Everyone knows your name\And that’s your whole claim to fame\Never miss a night\Cause your dream in life\Is to be a foot-baller’s wife\You don’t like play-ers\That’s what you say-a\But you really wouldn't mind a million-aire\You don’t like ball-ers\They don’t do nothing for ya\But you love a rich man six foot two or tall-er\You’re more than a fan\Looking for a man\But you end up with one night stands\He could be your whole life\If you got past one night\But that part never goes right\In the morning you’re vexed\He’s on to the next\And you didn't even get no taste\Don’t be too upset\If they call you a sket\Cause like the news every day you get pressed\You don’t like play-ers\That’s what you say-a\But you really wouldn't mind a million-aire\All them big ball-ers\They don’t do nothing for ya\But you love a rich man six foot two or tall-er\You can’t sit down right\Because your jeans are too tight\And you lucky it’s ladies' night\With your big empty purse\Every week it gets worse\At least your breast cost more than hers\So you did Mi-am-i\Cause you got there for free\But somehow you missed the plane\You did too much E\Met some-bod-y\And spent the night getting caned\Without girls like you there’d be no fun\We’d go to the club and not see any-one\Without girls like you there’s no night life\All those men just go home to their wives\Don’t be mad at me\Cause your pushing 30\And your old tricks no longer work\You should have known from the jump\That you always get dumped\So dust off your fuck me pumps"

The Way I Am	Eminem	"…Man, whatever\Dre, just let it run\Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit\Ayo, this song is for anyone\Fuck it, just shut up and listen, ayo\I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag\Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be\The most meanest MC on this—on this Earth\And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse\And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works\And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension\Dispensing these sentences, getting this stress\That's been eating me recently off of this chest\And I rest again peacefully\But at least have the decency in you\To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out\In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter\To not come and speak to me, I don't know you\And no, I don't owe you a mothafuckin' thing\I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think\I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick if you tempt me\My tank is on empty, no patience is in me\And if you offend me, I'm lifting you ten feet in the air\I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you\Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit\I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe\I'm tired of all you, I don't mean to be mean\But that's all I can be, it's just me\And I am whatever you say I am\If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?\In the paper, the news, every day I am\Radio won't even play my jam\'Cause I am whatever you say I am\If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?\In the paper, the news, every day I am\I don't know, it's just the way I am\Sometimes I just feel like my father\I hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense\It's constant, and, "Oh, it's his lyrical content\The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses."\And all of this controversy circles me\And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me\So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie\Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up\When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up\With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too\When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school\And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin\Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!\Middle America, now it's a tragedy\Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city havin' this happening\Then attack Eminem ‘cause I rap this way\But I'm glad, ‘cause they feed me the fuel that I need\For the fire to burn, and it's burning, and I have returned\And I am whatever you say I am\If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?\In the paper, the news, every day I am\Radio won't even play my jam\'Cause I am whatever you say I am\If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?\In the paper, the news, every day I am\I don't know, it's just the way I am\I'm so sick and tired of being admired\That I wish that I would just die or get fired\And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables\I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name Is"\And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation\To cop me rotation at rock-n-roll stations\And I just do not got the patience\To deal with these cocky Caucasians\Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black\‘Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls\So they always keep asking the same fucking questions\What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in\The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how\'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearin' it out\‘Cause they driving me crazy, I can't take it\I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit\And I'm thankful for every fan that I get\But I can't take a shit\In the bathroom without someone standing by it\No, I won't sign you an autograph\You can call me an asshole, I'm glad\'Cause I am whatever you say I am\If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?\In the paper, the news, every day I am\Radio won't even play my jam\'Cause I am whatever you say I am\If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?\In the paper, the news, every day I am\I don't know, it's just the way I am"

Oceania	Björk	"One breath away from mother Oceania\Your nimble feet make prints in my sands\You have done good for yourselves\Since you left my wet embrace\And crawled ashore\Every boy, is a snake is a lily\Every pearl is a lynx, is a girl\Sweet like harmony made into flesh\You dance by my side\Children sublime\You show me continents\I see islands\You count the centuries\I blink my eyes\Hawks and sparrows race in my waters\Stingrays are floating\Across the sky\Little ones, my sons and my daughters\Your sweat is salty\I am why, I am why\I am why\Your sweat is salty\I am why, I am why\I am why, I am why"

Thinking of You	Katy Perry	"Comparisons are easily done\Once you've had a taste of perfection\Like an apple hanging from a tree\I picked the ripest one\I still got the seed\You said move on, where do I go?\I guess second best is all I will know\'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you\Thinking of you\What you would do if\You were the one who was spending the night\Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes\You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter\Like a hard candy with a surprise center\How do I get better once I've had the best?\You said there's tons of fish in the water\So the waters I will test\He kissed my lips, I taste your mouth, oh\He pulled me in, I was disgusted with myself\'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you\Thinking of you\What you would do if\You were the one who was spending the night\Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes\You're the best\And yes I do regret\How I could let myself let you go\Now the lesson's learned\I touched it, I was burned\Oh, I think you should know\'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you\Thinking of you\What you would do if\You were the one who was spending the night\Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes\Looking into your eyes\Looking into your eyes\Oh, won't you walk through\And bust in the door and take me away\Oh, no more mistakes\'Cause in your eyes I'd like to stay"

Prelude	All Left Out	"Many years ago, I reached a point in my life I didn't like very much\I've become a lonely and unpleasant person\When I really thought about it, I felt conviction stirring deep within me\A yearning for something better than what I've yearned\This strange yearning grew so strong, that it became impossible to ignore\Whatever it was, I knew it wouldn't go away if I did nothing\I wasn't sure exactly what I should do, or where I should go\But I felt some sense of peace, that the conviction I felt\Would lead me when the time is right\Finally, after no small amount of procrastination\I made a decision to embark on a journey of discovery\It seems like so long ago now, That I can still remember that fateful day\The day that I began..\The Conquest..."

Young brothers and sisters\There's a world's worth of work and a need for you\Oh, change is coming, feel these doors now closing in\Is there no world for tomorrow, if we wait for today?\So march to the drumming, show them you're coming\You've been their play (toy)\Cut to the carving, bleed them 'til running\Enough, they'll take no more\You've been given all the power, boy\Now, go and make your move\Curse us, these gods aren't faking\Have mercy on the cowards, boys\They'll pray to have you lose\Help us, this world's now breaking\So now, they've noticed all you've given in sound\Let us in, let us in\Give me love over life, the sweet soft of ground\Let us in, let us in, now\Bye-bye, world\Or will our hope still hold on?\Boy, you're never going to see\The things that'll come of these (days)\(Raise your hands high!)

Come, Momma! As I need"\I said, "Come, Momma! Come, Momma! Watch it bleed"\Oh, what did I do to deserve all of this?\What did I do to deserve all of you?\(Raise your hands high!)

Man in the Mirror	Michael Jackson	"I'm gonna make a change\For once in my life\It's gonna feel real good\Gonna make a difference\Gonna make it right\As I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat\This wind is blowin' my mind\I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat\Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs\A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top\And one man's soul\They follow each other on the wind ya know\Cause they got nowhere to go\That's why I want you to know\I'm starting with the man in the mirror\I'm asking him to change his ways\And no message could have been any clearer\If you wanna make the world a better place\Take a look at yourself and then make a change\I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love\It's time that I realize\There are some with no home\Not a nickel to loan\Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone\A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart\And a washed out dream\They follow the pattern of the wind ya see\Cause they got no place to be\That's why I'm starting with me\I'm starting with the man in the mirror\I'm asking him to change his ways\And no message could have been any clearer\If you wanna make the world a better place\Take a look at yourself and then make a change\Take a look at yourself and then make the change\You gotta get it right, while you got the time\Cause when you close your heart\Then you close your mind\Make that change!"
When I'm Gone	Eminem	"Yeah, it's my life\In my own words, I guess\Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?\Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for\When they know they're your heart, and you know you were their armor\And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her\But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?\And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?\What happens when you become the main source of her pain?\"Daddy, look what I made!" "Dad's gotta go catch a plane"\"Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?"\"I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy\Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon' write itself\I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself"\Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her\And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her\That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy\Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby\And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn\Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling\And I didn't feel a thang, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back\And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn\Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling\And I didn't feel a thang, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back\I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing\She keeps screaming she don't want me to sing\"You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?"\"Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more" "Daddy, you're lyin'!\You always say that, you always say this is the last time\But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy, you're mine!"\She's piling boxes in front of the door, tryna block it\"Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!"\Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket\It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with ya!"\I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror\These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man, I can hear 'em\They're saying, "You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight\Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late!"\And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door\It turns to a stage, they're gone and this spotlight is on, and I'm singing—\And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn\Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling\And I didn't feel a thang\So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back\And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn\Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling\And I didn't feel a thang\So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back\Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat\The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet\I take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out\They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd\I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'\"Daddy, it's me!

Autumn	Joanna Newsom	"Driven through by her own sword\Summer died last night, alone\Even the ghosts\Huddled up for warmth\Autumn has come to my hometown\Friendly voices, dead and gone\Singing, Star of the country down...\(Even the ghosts help raise the barn\Here, now, in my hometown)\When, out of the massing\That bodes and bides, in the cold west\Flew a waxwing, who froze\And died against my breast!\All the while, rain\Like a weed in the tide\Swans and lists, down\On the gossiping lawns\Saying tsk tsk tsk\I may have changed. It's hard to gauge\Time won't account for how I've aged\Would I could tie your lying tongue\Who says that leaving keeps you young\I have got no control\Over my heart, over my mind\Over the hills, the rainclouds roll\I'll winter here, wait for a sign\To cast myself\Out, over the water\Riven like a wishbone\You'd hardly guess\I was my own mother's daughter;\I ain't naturally given to roam\I lay low, when I return\And I move\Like a gurney\Whose wheels are squeaking\Alone, here in my home\And I laugh\When you speak of my\Pleasure-seeking\Among the tall pines\Along the ley-lines\Here, where the loon keens\There, where the moon leans\There\Where I know my violent love lays down\In a row of silent, dove-gray days\Here, in a row of silent, dove-gray days\Wherever I go, I am snowbound\By thoughts of him\Whom I would sun\I loved them all\One by one\Cannot gain ground\Cannot outrun;\But time marches along\You can't always stick around\But, when the final count is done\I will be in my hometown\I will be in my hometown"

Don't Let Me Fall	B.o.B	"Well it was just a dream, just a moment ago\I was up so high, lookin' down at the sky, don't let me fall\I was shootin' for stars, on a Saturday night\They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall\Don't let me fall, don't let me fall\They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall\Don't let me fall\'Cause I'm glidin' up there, oh so very high\That if the, clouds were to drop me, then I'd, fall out the sky\I don't really, know why I'm here, I guess I'm, just here for the ride\I swear it, feels like I'm dreamin', it's vividly defined, yeah\So call me whatever you want, title me whatever you like\But let's get one thing straight, you know my name\So I run this town, when I'm on this mic\Yeah, so here I go, B.o.B, Bobby Ray, I don't know, need I know\But I know, that I flow, rack 'em up, knock 'em down, dominoes\Then I go, as my story goes\I know I've done been down here before\Product of my East Decatur home\'Cause I was in the cold, tryin' to keep my toes unfroze\Now I'm in your house, now I'm in your soul\Now I'm everywhere that your iPod go\Everything I seen was a dream just a moment ago\Well it was just a dream, just a moment ago\I was up so high, lookin' down at the sky, don't let me fall\I was shootin' for stars, on a Saturday night\They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall\Don't let me fall, don't let me fall\They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall\Don't let me fall\Yeah, well I'm from much lower than where that pavement is\'Cause there ain't no parachute that they can make for this\'Cause I put my pain, my heart, my soul, my faith in this\Does anyone feel like how I feel? Then you can relate to this\Or just blaze of this, maybe roll one up, then take a hit\Toast to the good life then take a sip\Vacay everyday, yeah take a trip\It's easy to see I was made for this\From the womb all the way to the grave I spit\Just to show y'all niggas what greatness is\Yeah, I'm talkin' very lucid, like makin' movies\To picture my life boy, you need a higher resolution\I used to cut class in the day, then run away at night\But now I'm ruler of the upper class and I don't even write\Well it was just a dream, just a moment ago\I was up so high, lookin' down at the sky, don't let me fall\I was shootin' for stars, on a Saturday night\They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall\Don't let me fall, don't let me fall\They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall\Don't let me fall"

Esme	Joanna Newsom	"I can feel a difference\Today, a difference\All of us in our tents\Fearing god like a mistress\We lay on the rocks in the sun\Watching you and your mama row in\I sat up and blinked when you appeared\So pale you were nearly clear\Later I stumbled to my bed\All alone in the branches\I laid in the dark thinking about\All of my friends and their changes\And I do not know\If you know just what you have done\You are the sweetest one\I have ever laid my eyes upon\It's a beautiful town\With the rain coming down\Blackberry, rosemary\Jimmy-crack-corn\You've got the run of the place\Now that you're running around\And may kindness,\Kindness, kindness abound\In this hour of our lives\Hour of effortless plenty\How do we know which parts of our hearts want what\With such base generosity?\Taking so many photographs, so amazed!\We've never seen a baby so newlyborn\And when the bulbs do flash as bright as morning\The crowd keeps on gathering like an electric storm\The phantom of love moves among us at will\Each phantom-limb lost has got an angel\So confused like the wagging bobbed-tail of a bulldog\Kindness, kindness prevails\Kindness prevails!\Ties and rails, ties and rails fall into line bearing kindness\Where will you go, if not here?\What will you say when you write to us?\This is a world of terrible hardship everywhere\And I search for words to set you at ease\But there, in the looking-glass, a kite is soaring\Stilling my warring heart and my trembling knees\Clean as a breeze, bright as the day\All of the people gather to say\"Sweet Esme! Sweet Esme!"\Oh, oh, oh!\I believe love will always surround you\Brave as a bear with a heart rare and true\But if you are scared, if you are blue\I have prepared this small song for you:\Sweet Esme! Sweet Esme!\Oh, oh, oh!"

Wake Up	Coheed and Cambria	"I'm gonna ride this plane out of your life again\I wish that I could stay, but you argue\More than this, I wish you could've seen my face\In backseat, staring out the window\I'll do anything for you\Kill anyone for you\So leave yourself intact\'Cause I will be coming back\In a phrase to cut these lips\I love you\The morning will come\In the press of every kiss, with your head upon my chest\Where I will annoy you\With every waking breath, until you decide to wake up\I've earned through hope and faith\On the curves around your face\That I'm the one you'll hold, forever\If morning never comes for either one of us\Then this, I pray to you, wherever\I'll do anything for you, this story is for you\('Cause I'd do anything you want me to, for you)\I'll do anything for you, kill anyone for you\So leave yourself intact\'Cause I won't be coming back\In a phrase to cut these lips\I loved you\The morning will come\In the press of every kiss, with your head upon my chest\Where I will annoy you\With every waking breath, until you decide to wake up\The morning will come\In the press of every kiss, with your head upon my chest\Where I will annoy you\With every waking breath, 'til you decide to wake up"

Sway\Now we dread the dark in which we used to play\We've been there/ done that/ nothing can impress\Relax! the music's so loud no one can hear this\I was out last night, I guess I'm just a little tired\Like I'm constantly drowning, but thirsty all the same\Now step to the left two steps to the right\No, I'm not crying; it's all this smoke that's to blame\Night-child\I'm a night-child\And I pour a glass for two and down it all alone\Do you think any of these people will visit my grave stone?\Do you have a lighter? Come light my cigarette\All these people around me, I can’t possibly feel alone"

forbidden lover	L'Arc~en~Ciel	"あぁ凍える暗い海へ\流されてゆく歴史の波にのまれ\やがて幕は上がり\儚い夢を連れて争いに火をつける\いつの日に見失った心は 繰り返す忘れ去られた罪を\あやまちを育てその汚れた愛で 瓦礫に築く楽園\Forbidden lover..... 淡い記憶\強く抱いても重なり合えぬ色彩\息をひそめ誓う\甘い恋の果ては予期せぬ時の悪戯\燃え上がる炎に取り囲まれ 崩れゆく船に命つかまれ\怯えた瞳は天を仰いで 叫ぶ神の名を\空高く舞い上がれこの心 渦巻いた悪い夢より高く\解き放つ貴方へのこの想い 遠い地へ輝きを放って\新たなる国に やがて来る日にも\同じ道をまた通るだろうか\Forbidden lover....."

Easy	Joanna Newsom	"Easy\Easy\My man and me\We could rest and remain here, easily\We are tested and pained by\What's beyond our bed\We're blessed and sustained by\What is not said\No one knows what is coming\Or who will harvest what we have sown\Or how I've been dulling and dumbing\In the service of the heart alone\Or how I am worn to the bone by the river\And in the river, made of light\I'm your little life-giver\I will give my life\Haven't you seen what I've seen?\Don't you know what you ought to do?\I was born to love\And I intend to love you\Down in the valley where the fields are green\Watch my luck turn, fro and to\Pluck every last daisy clean\Till only I may love you\I am easy\Easy to keep\Honey, you please me\Even in your sleep\But my arms want to carry\My heart wants to hold\Tell me your worries\I wanna be told\Sit and see how the fog from the port in the bay\Lays like snow at the foot of the Roanoke\Hear the frog going courtin'\Till the day he croaks\Saying even then\How there is light in the river\And there's a river made of light\C'mon, you little life-giver\Give your life\Who asked you?\Who asked you if you wanna be\Loved by me?\Who died and made you\In charge of who loves who?\All the livelong day\If I have my way I will love you\But one can't carry the weight\Or change the fate of two\I've been waiting for a break\How long's it gonna take?\Let me love you\How about it?\How about what I have to say?\How about that livelong day?\How am I gonna stay here without you?\Easy\Easy\You must not fear\You must meet me to see me\I am barely here\But like a Bloody Mary\Seen in the mirror\Speak my name\And I appear\Speak my name\And I appear\Speak\And I appear"

ART OF LIFE	X Japan	"Desert Rose, why do you live alone?\If you are sad, I'll make you leave this life\Are you white, blue or bloody red?\All I can see is drowning in cold grey sand\The winds of time, you knock me to the ground\I'm dying of thirst, I wanna run away\I don't know how to set me free to live\My mind cries out feeling pain\I've been roaming to find myself\How long have I been feeling endless hurt\Falling down, rain flows into my heart\In the pain I'm waiting for you\Can't go back, no place to go back to\Life is lost, flowers fall\If it's all dreams, now wake me up\If it's all real, just kill me\I'm making the wall inside my heart\I don't wanna let my emotions get out\It scares me to look at the world\Don't want to find myself lost in your eyes\I tried to drown my past in grey\I never wanna feel more pain\Ran away from you without saying any words\What I don't wanna lose is love\Through my eyes\Time goes by like tears\My emotion's losing the color of life\Kill my heart\Release all my pain\I'm shouting out louder\Insanity takes hold over me\Turning away from the wall\Nothing I can see\The scream deep inside\Reflecting another person in my heart\He calls me from within\"All existence you see before you must be wiped out:\Dream, Reality, Memories, and Yourself"\I begin to lose control of myself\My lust is so blind, destroys my mind\Nobody can stop my turning to madness\No matter how you try to hold me in your heart\Why do you wanna raise these walls\I don't know the meaning of hatred\My brain gets blown away hearing words of lies\I only want to hold your love\Stab the dolls filled with hate\Wash yourself with their blood\Drive into the raging current of time\Swing your murderous weapon into the belly\"the earth"\Shout and start creating confusion\Shed your blood for pleasure\And what? For love?\What am I supposed to do?\I believe in the madness called "Now"\Past and future prison my heart\Time is blind\But I wanna trace my love on the wall of time\Over pain in my heart\Art of life\Insane blade stabbing dreams\Try to break all truth now\But I can't heal this broken heart in pain\Cannot start to live, Cannot end my life\Keep on cry\Close my eyes\Time breathes I can hear\All love and sadness\Melt in my heart\Dry my tears\Wipe my bloody face\I wanna feel me living my life\Outside my walls\You can't draw a picture of yesterday, so you're painting your heart with your blood. You can't say "No," only turning the wheel of time with a rope around your neck. You build a wall of morality and take a breath from between the bricks. You make up imaginary enemies and are chased by them. You're trying to commit suicide. You're satisfied with your prologue. Now you're painting your first chapter black. You are putting the scraps of life together and trying to make an asylum for yourself. You're hitting a bell at the edge of the stage. And you are trying to kill me\I believe in the madness called "Now"\Time goes flowing, breaking my heart\Wanna live, can't let my heart kill myself\Still I haven't found what I'm looking for\Art of life\I try to stop myself\But my heart goes to destroy the truth\Tell me why\I want the meaning of my life\Do I try to live?\Do I try to love in my dream?\I'm breaking the wall inside my heart\I just wanna let my emotions get out\Nobody can stop my running to freedom\No matter how you try to hold me in your world\Like a doll carried by the flow of time\I sacrificed the present moment for the future\I was in chains of memory half-blinded\Losing my heart, walking in the sea of dreams\Close my eyes\Rose breathes I can hear\All love and sadness melt in my heart\Dry my tears\Wipe my bloody face\I wanna feel me living my life outside my mind\Dreams can make me mad\I can't leave my dream\I can't stop myself\Don't know what I am\What lies are truth?\What truths are lies?\I believe in the madness called "Now"\Time goes flowing, breaking my heart\Wanna live, can't let my heart kill myself\Still I haven't found what I'm looking for\Art of life, I try to stop myself\But my heart goes to destroy the truth\Tell me why, I want the meaning of my life\Do I try to live? Do I try to love?\Art of life, an Eternal Bleeding heart\You never wanna breathe your last\Wanna live, can't let my heart kill myself\Still I'm feeling for a rose is breathing love\In my life"

Nobody's Home	Avril Lavigne	"Well I couldn't tell you\Why she felt that way\She felt it everyday\And I couldn't help her\I just watched her make\The same mistakes again\What's wrong, what's wrong now?\Too many, too many problems\Don't know where she belongs, where she belongs\She wants to go home, but nobody's home\It's where she lies, broken inside\With no place to go, no place to go\To dry her eyes, broken inside\Open your eyes\And look outside\Find the reasons why\You've been rejected\And now you can't find\What you've left behind\Be strong, be strong now\Too many, too many problems\Don't know where she belongs, where she belongs\She wants to go home , but nobody's home\It's where she lies, broken inside\With no place to go, no place to go\To dry her eyes, broken inside\Her feelings she hides\Her dreams she can't find\She's losing her mind\She's fallen behind\She can't find her place\She's losing her faith\She's fallen from grace\She's all over the place\Yeah\She wants to go home, but nobody's home\It's where she lies, broken inside\With no place to go, no place to go\To dry her eyes, broken inside\She's lost inside, lost inside, oh oh\She's lost inside, lost inside, oh oh oh"

Faint	Linkin Park	"I am a little bit of loneliness\A little bit of disregard\Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact\That everyone can see these scars\I am what I want you to want\What I want you to feel\But, it's like no matter what I do\I can't convince you to just believe this is real\So, I let go, watching you\Turn your back like you always do\Face away and pretend that I'm not\But, I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got\I can't feel the way I did, before\Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored\Time won't heal this damage, anymore\Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored\I am a little bit insecure\A little unconfident\'Cause you don't understand I do what I can\But sometimes, I don't make sense\I am what you never wanna say\But, I've never had a doubt\It's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you\For once, just to hear me out\So, I let go, watching you\Turn your back like you always do\Face away and pretend that I'm not\But, I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got\I can't feel the way I did, before\Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored\Time won't heal this damage, anymore\Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored\Now, hear me out, now\You're gonna listen to me, like it or not\Right now, hear me out, now\You're gonna listen to me, like it or not\Right now\I can't feel the way I did, before\Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored\I can't feel the way I did, before\Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored\Time won't heal this damage, anymore\Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored\I can't feel...\Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored\Time won't heal...\Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored"
We Belong Together	Mariah Carey	"Sweet love yeah\I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so\I should have held on tight, I never should have let you go\I didn't know nothing I was stupid\I was foolish, I was lying to myself\I couldn’t have fathomed I would ever be without your love\Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself\’Cause I didn’t know you, ’cause I didn’t know me\But I thought I knew everything I never felt\The feeling that I’m feeling now that I don’t hear your voice\Or have your touch and kiss your lips\‘Cause I don’t have a choice\Or what I wouldn’t give to have you lying by my side\Right here\’Cause baby\Baby, when you left I lost a part of me\It's still so hard to believe\Come back baby please\‘Cause we belong together\Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?\Who’s going to talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?\Who’s going to take your place? There ain't nobody better\Oh, baby baby, we belong together\I can't sleep at night, when you're on my mind\Bobby Womack's on the radio\Saying to me, "If you think you're lonely now"\Wait a minute this is too deep (too deep)\I gotta change the station\So I turn the dial trying to catch a break\And then I hear Babyface\I only think of you\It's breaking my heart\I'm trying to keep it together but I'm falling apart\I'm feeling all out of my element\Throwing things crying trying to figure out\Where the hell I went wrong\Pain reflected in this song\Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside\I need you need you back in my life baby\Baby, when you left I lost a part of me\It's still so hard to believe\Come back baby please\‘Cause we belong together\Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?\Who’s going to talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?\Who’s going to take your place? There ain't nobody better\Oh, baby baby, we belong together\Baby, when you left I lost a part of me\It's still so hard to believe\Come back baby please\‘Cause we belong together\Who am I gon' lean on when times get rough?\Who’s going to talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?\Who’s going to take your place? There ain't nobody better\Oh, baby baby, we belong together"

Night Like This	Hilary Duff	"I've been watching the phases of the moon from my window pane\I've been talking to corners of the room for too long\Too long\Met you when my heart was somewhere else\Outside in the rain\Saw you smiling, the stories you could tell\Have you moved on?\Moved on\It's so hard to get a cab at midnight on Friday\Where you going? Downtown\So am I\Stand right here, where it's dry, and if you said you're going my way\Well, maybe we should share a ride\I could feel my heartbeat electric to my fingertips\Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\I could feel anticipation through my veins\Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\I can almost feel the weight of your kiss on my lips\'Cause anything could happen on a night like this\On a night like this\Wouldn't mind if we caught every red light\You're someone I can get close to\You're a stranger, but there's something in your eyes\Like you know me\Could I know you?\Well, I never fell in love at midnight on Friday\Standing outside of town, in the rain\Well, this ride is almost over\But if I had it my way, we would just stay up all night\I could feel my heartbeat electric to my fingertips\Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\I could feel anticipation through my veins\Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\I can almost feel the weight of your kiss on my lips\'Cause anything could happen on a night like this\On a night like this\Our hands fit just the right way\Our legs tangled up in this small space\The world outside feels far away, as I get to know you\I could feel my heartbeat electric to my fingertips\Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\I could feel anticipation through my veins\Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\I can almost feel the weight of your kiss on my lips\'Cause anything could happen on a night like this\On a night like this\Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\Anything could happen on a night like this\On a night like this\On a night like this\On a night like this"

Does Not Suffice	Joanna Newsom	"I will pack all my pretty dresses\I will box up my high-heeled shoes\A sparkling ring for every finger\I'll put away and hide from view\Coats of boucle, jacquard and cashmere\Cartouche and tweed, all silver-shot\And everything that could remind you\Of how easy I was not\I'll tuck away my gilded buttons\I'll bind my silks in shapeless bales\Wrap it all up in reams o' tissue\And then I'll kiss you sweet farewell\You saw me rise to our occasion\And so deny the evidence\'Caused me to burn and twist and grimace against you\Like something caught on a barbed wire fence\Now you can see me fall back here redoubled\Full bewildered and amazed\I have gotten into some terrible trouble\Beneath your blank and rinsing gaze\It does not suffice for you to say I am a sweet girl\Or to say you hate to see me sad because of you\It does not suffice to merely lie beside each other\As those who love each other do\I picture you rising up in the morning\Stretching out on your boundless bed\Beating a clear path to the shower\Scouring yourself red\The tap of hangers swaying in the closet\Unburdened hooks and empty drawers\And everywhere I tried to love you\Is yours again and only yours\La-la-la-la..."

Go Long	Joanna Newsom	"Last night, again\You were in my dreams\Several expendable limbs were at stake\You were a prince, spinning rims\All sentiments indian-given\And half-baked\I was brought\In on a palanquin\Made of the many bodies\Of beautiful women\Brought to this place to be examined\Swaying on an elephant:\A princess of india\We both want the very same thing\We are praying\I am the one to save you\But you don't even own\Your own violence\Run away from home-\Your beard is still blue\With the loneliness of you mighty men\With your jaws, and fists, and guitars\And pens, and your sugarlip\But I've never been to the firepits with you mighty men\Who made you this way?\Who made you this way?\Who is going to bear your beautiful children?\Do you think you can just stop\When you're ready for a change?\Who will take care of you\When you're old and dying?\You burn in the Mekong\To prove your worth,\Go Long! Go Long!\Right over the edge of the earth!\You have been wronged\Tore up since birth\You have done harm\Others have done worse\Will you tuck your shirt?\Will you leave it loose?\You are badly hurt\You're a silly goose\You are caked in mud\And in blood, and worse\Chew your bitter cud\Grope your little nurse.\Do you know why\My ankles are bound in gauze\(sickly dressage:\A princess of kentucky)?\In the middle of the woods\(which were the probable cause)\We danced in the lodge\Like two panting monkeys\I will give you a call, for one last hurrah\If this tale is tall, forgive my scrambling\But you keep palming along the wall\Moving at a blind crawl\But always rambling.\Wolf-spider, crouch in your funnel nest,\If I knew you, once\Now I know you less\In the sinking sand\Where we've come to rest,\Have I had a hand in your loneliness?\When you leave me alone\In this old palace of yours\It starts to get to me. I take to walking\What a woman does is open doors\And it is not a question of locking\Or unlocking\Well, I have never seen\Such a terrible room-\Gilded with the gold teeth\Of the women who loved you!\Now, though I die\Magpie, this I bequeath:\By any other name\A jay is still blue\With the loneliness\Of you mighty men\With your mighty kiss\That might never, never end\While, so far away\In the seat of the west\Burns the fount\Of the heat\Of that loneliness\There's a man\Who only will speak in code\Backing slowly, slowly down the road\May he master everything\That such men may know\About loving, and then letting go"

Message	Jamie Woon	"Message from the victor via satellite\Well, it's nice to know I'm doing something right\Guess it's my lucky night\Message from the leader on the giant screen\We need to talk about the way that it could be\In 2023\Oh\Waiting for the start to go\Waiting for the wind to blow\Right through my ache and hunger\Oh\Waiting for some heart to show\Waiting for the grass to grow\I'm coming up from under\I have to say that it was all I could do to decide\When I was with it I was playing ahead of the time\Made a start and I was walking to weather the stone\But if you look up and you stop...\The later you wait, you're missing the waterfall\Where did it go?\No, not a lot is so well-defined now\No medicine to know it all\I reach out for lightness in the eyes\Letter to the future in the diary\I loved the summer and the swelling of the sea\Brought out the best in me\Letter to the juror and my alibi\My understanding was that I was doing fine\Above the waterline\Oh\Waiting for the start to go\Waiting for the wind to blow\Right through my ache and hunger\Oh\Waiting for some heart to show\Waiting for the grass to grow\I'm coming up from under\(oooh)\(lalalalalala)"
How Could I Want More	Jamie Lynn Spears	"Lying in the green grass\Underneath the blue sky\Looking at a good man\Who oughta be the right guy\He's got that kinda heart that\Any girl would die for\So, how could I want more?\How could I want more?\Treats me like a princess\Let's me have it my way\I can tell he's hanging\On every word that I say\All he does is love me\Swears that's what he's here for\So, how could I want more?\How could I want more?\More fire, more feeling\More stars than what I'm seeing\More hope for what I'd find behind that door\More power, more passion\Instead of just acting\Like I'm the one that he's been looking for\I oughta say I'm sorry\I oughta say it's over\Let him live his own life\Stop crying on the shoulder\He'd probably say it's alright\And hold me while me tears pour\So, how could I want more?\How could I want more?\More fire, more feeling\More stars than what I'm seeing\More hope for what I'd find behind that door\More power, more passion\Instead of just acting\Like I'm the one that he's been looking for\Lying in the green grass\Underneath the blue sky\Looking at a good man\And I know he's the right guy\He's got that kinda heart that\Any girl would die for\So, how could I want more?\How could I want more?"

Come Monday Night	God Help the Girl	"Come Monday night, the day of work is done\Tuesday morning looms, the grey of ordinariness\Start by putting off your chores\And all the crushing bores\Say your morning prayers\Sing a rousing song\Then sing it on the long walk home\Come Monday night we're in a state of grace\Twenty-million boys are caught up in a paper chase\If the weekend promised much\Then it failed to touch\On a single count what I was hoping for\What I was hoping for\Come Monday night we turn the telly off\To listen to the silence\Light that comes in from outside\If you could catch it all\And pin it to your wall\Then you would sleep much better\Baby you would sleep much better\Maybe you would sleep much better\Baby you would sleep much better\Maybe you would sleep much better\Baby you would sleep much better\Maybe you would sleep much better\Baby you would sleep much better\Maybe you would sleep much better\Baby you would sleep much better\Maybe you would sleep much better\Baby you would sleep much better"
Paint It Black	The Rolling Stones	"I see a red door and I want it painted black\No colours anymore, I want them to turn black\I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes\I have to turn my head until my darkness goes\I see a line of cars and they're all painted black\With flowers and my love, both never to come back\I see people turn their heads and quickly look away\Like a newborn baby, it just happens everyday\I look inside myself and see my heart is black\I see my red door and must have it painted black\Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts\It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black\No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue\I could not foresee this thing happening to you\If I look hard enough into the setting sun\My love will laugh with me before the morning comes\I see a red door and I want it painted black\No colours anymore, I want them to turn black\I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes\I have to turn my head until my darkness goes\I wanna see it painted, painted black\Black as night, black as coal\I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky\I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black\Yeah"

You Needed Me	Anne Murray	"I cried a tear, you wiped it dry\I was confused, you cleared my mind\I sold my soul, you bought it back for me\And held me up and gave me dignity\Somehow you needed me\You gave me strength to stand alone again\To face the world out on my own again\You put me high upon a pedestal\So high that I could almost see eternity\You needed me, you needed me\And I can't believe it's you I can't believe it's true\I needed you and you were there\And I'll never leave, why should I leave, I'd be a fool\'Cause I finally found someone who really cares\You held my hand when it was cold\When I was lost, you took me home\You gave me hope when I was at the end\And turned my lies back into truth again\You even called me friend\You gave me strength to stand alone again\To face the world out on my own again\You put me high upon a pedestal\So high that I could almost see eternity\You needed me, you needed me\You needed me, you needed me"

Jo	Goldfrapp	"Heard a shout and someone calling\Strained in darkness\Vapour, like a veil, hangs over\The city tonight\Hanging there behind the trees\A blood-red moon is watching\I was waiting for you\Dread in my heart\Where the wind sings by the river\Laughing, broken\Hair swept out into the water\Ripples of black\Run, you better run\You better run for your life\Oh, it rips through the sky\Oh, a light flickers on\Jo, I know you would say\“Don’t wait for me now”\Shiver while you’re breathe in\Hold on while you breathe loud\I see the dawn\Shiver while you breathe in\Hold on while I breath loud\Aah\Filigree of time demeaning\Sunset, spoken\Where the wind sings by the river\Ripples of black\Days, you gotta run\You gotta run for your life\Run, you better run\You better run for your life\Days, you gotta run\You gotta run for your life\Run, you better run\You better run for your life\Days, you gotta run\You gotta run for your life\Run, you better run\You better run for your life\Oh, you live 'til you breathe\Don’t run with me\Breathe your life while you wait\Don’t wait for me now"

Crossing The Frame	Coheed and Cambria	"Home, a silence between glares\That stutters words misleading here\Give me all you got\With one shot sent to lend me\No, here across the grass\Between the glass\I know you're not the one\I left to wait here, helping\I, I left in a sudden rush and never said why\You couldn't know that I had no goodbyes\But I wish that you were, I'm spying on you, Newo\The way that you would've been if\I stayed here at home, I'm giving it up, Newo\How important I could've been to you\Press the steps I take to cross your door frame if\You decide to answer when my fist swings hello\I left in a sudden rush and never said why\You couldn't know that I had no goodbyes\But I wish that you were, I'm spying on you, Newo\The way that you would've been if\I stayed here at home, I'm giving it up, Newo\How important I could've been to you\Casting quarters into wells that hold our dreams\You won't believe me if I told you so\Casting quarters into wells that hold our dreams\You won't believe me, I wouldn't if you told me so\But I wish that you were, I'm spying on you, Newo\The way that you would've been if\I stayed here at home, I'm giving it up, Newo\How important I could've been to you"

Oh No, Not My Baby	She & Him	"(originally by Goffin & King)\When my friends told me you had someone new\I didn't believe a single word was true\I showed them all I had a faith in you\I just kept on saying\Oh, no, not my baby\Oh, no, not my sweet baby\You're not like those other guys\Who lead you on and tell you lies\My mama told me when rumors spread\There's truth somewhere and I should use my head\But I didn't listen to what she said\I kept right on saying\Oh, no, not my baby\Oh, no, not my sweet baby\You're not like those other boys\Who play with hearts like they were toys\Well, you might have had a last minute fling\But I am sure it didn't mean a thing\'Cause yesterday you gave me your ring\And I'm so glad that I kept on saying\Oh, no, not my baby\Oh, no, not my sweet baby\You're not like those other guys\Who lead you on and tell you lies\Oh, no, not my baby\Oh, no, not my sweet baby\Oh, no, not my baby\Oh, no, not my sweet baby"

Through Oblivion	In Flames	"False affection took the best of me\Deep inside, the absent mind\Denial and hypocrisy\All this the same\To do this we part our ways\My destination, my mission, my intuition\So close I feel it changing me\Suddenly I know, I have to let it go\All that's been lost, all that's been won\Now I feel right before me\Intentions are pure, I'm out of reach\My destination, my mission, my intuition\So close I feel it changing me\I might dare to believe\And I have wings (I have)\Nothing and everything at the same time\Oh, a brighter sun\Save me from my fears\And darkest thought of her\Carry me through times\Through oblivion\My destination, my mission, my intuition\So close I feel it changing me\I might dare to believe\My destination, my mission, my intuition\So close I feel it changing me\I might dare to believe, cause now I know!"

Мост	Buhar Jerreau	"Очередного фильма роскошная реклама\У входа в музыкальный магазин висит экраном\В нарезанных сюжетах, глаза на мокром месте\Заснято крупным планом - придворные, лестные\В зале магазина музыка играет в грохоте\Песни западных новинок, засилье похоти\Звук тихонько растёт, на подходе к витринам\За спиной смолкает трейлер кинофильма\На глянцевых афишах у прилавка напротив\Фото женщины в полуобороте\Черты лица рекламные, в общей партитуре\Цыганские глаза и греческие скулы\Но среди превратности, роскоши и вздора\В образе обложки случайного альбома\Отвешивает живопись на выступе витрины\А этого достаточно любому магазину\Мост. Шарф. Дождь. Запах.\Зонт. Кисть. Взгляд. Достаточно.\Мост. Шум. Дождь. Запах.\Зонт. Кисть. Шаг. Достаточно.\Один художник около века тому назад\Даму у которой верные, как у собаки глаза\Изобразил в роскошном зелёном платье\И стоило чуть посмотреть мне на неё так на тебе\Вулкан который считался потухшим\Внезапно ожил и теперь переполняет душу\Я никогда не видел в живую, и увижу я навряд ли\Женщину в столь удивительном наряде\Эта одежда не о женской сексуальности\Которой в современности так подобать пытаются\А о женской женственности, где содержания полны\Материнской нежности и верности жены\Не говорю что нет сейчас обличий женственных\Но тех что на картине - не было и нет иных\Музей как обычно пуст, поделиться не с кем\Значит достаточно сделать это в песне\Мост. Шарф. Дождь. Запах.\Зонт. Кисть. Взгляд. Достаточно.\Мост. Шум. Дождь. Запах.\Зонт. Кисть. Шаг. Достаточно.\Я её встретил случайно, в одном из парков\Вы там бываете тоже, точно гуляли когда то\Кормили серых голубей, просто весной или летом\В один из тёплых дней может любовались кем то\Тонкая, юная, смуглая в белых наушниках\Стоит спиной ко мне, от меня в пару шагах\Я прикоснулся к плечам её хрупким и нежным\Увидел взгляд её тот самый добрый, вежливый\Я спросил время, она засмеялась\И я не удержался, пусть и растерянный малость\Затем вдруг внезапно, она взяла мою руку\И потащила куда то, зачем то, почему то\Я не узнал телефон её, адрес, имя\Это не имело значения в контексте той картины\Осталось воспоминание, чудесное милое\И этого достаточно чтобы быть счастливым\Мост. Шарф. Дождь. Запах.\Зонт. Кисть. Взгляд. Достаточно.\Мост. Шум. Дождь. Запах.\Зонт. Кисть. Шаг. Достаточно."

Good Intentions Paving Company	Joanna Newsom	"Twenty miles left to the show\Hello, my old country, Hello\Stars are just beginning to appear\And I have never, in my life\Before been here\And it's my heart, not me\Who cannot drive\At which conclusion you arrived\Watching me sit here, bolt upright\And cry for no good reason\At the Eastering sky\And the tilt of this strange nation\And the will to remain for the duration\(waving the flag\Feeling it drag)\Like a bump on a bump on a log, baby;\Like I'm in a fistfight with the fog, baby;\Step, ball-change, and a pirouette!\And I regret\How I said to you\Honey, just open your heart\When I've got trouble\Even opening a honey jar\And that, right there, is where we are\I've been fessing, double-fast\Addressing questions nobody asked\I'll get this joy off of my chest, at last\And I will love you\Till the noise has long since passed\And I did not mean to shout. Just drive\Just get us out, dead or alive\The road's too long to mention--\Lord, it's something to see!--\Laid down by the\Good Intentions Paving Company\All the way to the thing\We've been playing at, darling\I can see that you're wearing\Your staying-hat, darling\For the time being, all is well\Won't you love me a spell?\This is blindness beyond all conceiving\While, behind us, the road is leaving\And leaving, and falling back\Like a rope gone slack\Well, I saw straightaway\That the lay was steep\But I fell for you, honey\Easy as falling asleep\And that, right there\Is the course I keep\And no amount of talking\Is going to soften the fall\But, like after the rain\Step out of the overhang. That's all\It had a nice ring to it\When the old opry house rang\So, with a solemn auld lang\Syne, sealed, delivered\I sang\And there is hesitation\And it always remains\(concerning you, me\And the rest of the gang)\And in our quiet hour\I feel I see everything\And am in love\With the hook\Upon which everyone hangs\And I know you meant\To show the extent\To which you gave a goddang--\You ranged real hot and real cold\But I'm sold\I am at home on that range\And I do hate to fold\Right here, at the top of my game\When I've been trying\With my whole heart and soul\To stay right here, in the right lane\But it can make you feel over, and old\(Lord, you know it's a shame)\When I only want for you to pull over\And hold me\Till I can't remember my own name"

Mothers of Men	Coheed and Cambria	"In this space where nothing will seem too right\Our voice unheard in this quiet fight\This march we lead will breed our song\To them we're nothing, to them we're pawns\Oh, a desperate play to feel like we belong\Now, as we take up into the streets, remember\I depend on you as much as you on me\Don't try to fake it, let's not pretend\We made you mothers, we made you men\We made you mothers, we made you men\Oh, it's no surprise, nobody listens anymore\To what we're saying, to what was said\And in your absence we promised you\"We'll behave, oh, we'll behave"\So just keep running\Everything will look better once you look away\Cause what's the difference?, oh, is there a difference we make?\(Your day will come...)\The rain starts dancing across our backs\These ardent words seize this heart attack\Belief still strong, we can make this change\The stage is set to occupy the brain\This stage is, we made this, we made this...\We made it!\Oh, it's no surprise, nobody listens anymore\To what we're saying, to what was said (To what we're saying...)\And in your absence we promised you\"We'll behave, oh, we'll behave" (We misbehaved...)\So just keep running\Everything will look better once you look away\Cause what's the difference, oh, is there a difference we make?\Between a dapper villain in a Sunday serial at the podium\Or another cog in the wheel\Just another cog in the wheel\They're both capable of making life hard\No bandage can mend all these parts\So why do I give?\Between, between, between\Between, between, between\Between, between, between\Oh, it's no surprise, nobody listens anymore\To what we're saying, to what was said (To what we're saying...)\And in your absence we promised you\"We'll behave, oh, we'll behave" (We misbehaved...)\So just keep running\Everything will look better once you look away\Cause what's the difference, oh, what's the difference\In making life hard?\No bandage can mend all these parts\So why do I live with this?\No difference...\(Dyer: "Good night.")"
The Afterman	Coheed and Cambria	"She gave her heart to a falling star\When news filtered through of his tragedy\All the walls went up\Around a world, she declines\As the tears from her eyes fall\No one understands and no one will\All she has lost\If he's not here, then where?\If he's not here, then where?\If he's not here, then where?\If he's not here, then where?\When she found it, there\In the cold, blue glare\The words distressed and unfamiliar\Where the feelings seared\An emptiness had hung\And in her chest, she clenched\Reality settled as the memories raced\While on the screen, he lived\She teared; "Your selfishness has robbed you\Of the man you could've been\I wouldn't change a thing about you\I love you dearly, my friend"\If he's not here, then where?\If he's not here, then where?\My love, been searching for my Afterman\If he's not here, then where?\If he's not here, then where?\My love, been searching for my Afterman"

You and Me, Bess	Joanna Newsom	"We picked our way\Down to the beach\Watching the waves dragging out of our reach\Tangling tails like a sodden sheet\Dangling entrails from a gut of the sea\Hoarding our meals\Alfalfa and rolls\Trying not to catch the cold eye of the gulls\I hope mother nature has not overheard\Though she doles out hurt like a puking bird\You stayed for the winter\No one told us about the laws of the land\I hold my own but you with your hunger\You and the other hand\Make yourself known\And when we were found\I know we both grieved\My heart made the sound of snow falling from eaves\You and me, Bess\We was as thick as thieves\So I swore nonetheless\Up and down, it was only me\So they took me away\And after some time\Studying my case must have made up their minds\By the time you realized I was dying\Must have been too late\I believe you were not lying a little\It is the day I\Wait with my ears cocked up like a gun\Like every day of course\Yanked by my wrists to the\Sugar front court yard\Now tell me what have I done?\Seems I have stolen a horse and I\Step to the gallows\Who do you think that you are?\Arching your hooves like a crane in the shallow\Gutters that line the boulevards\Powdered with folks who just stare as I hang\It's all the same\Kindness comes over me\What was your name?\It makes no difference I'm glad that you came\Forever I'll listen to your glad neighing"
On a Good Day	Joanna Newsom	"Hey hey hey the end is near\On a good day you can see the end from here\But I won't turn back now though the way is clear\I will stay for the remainder\I saw a life and I called it mine\I saw it drawn so sweet and fine\And I had begun to fill in all the lines\Right down to what we'd name her\Our nature does not change by will\In the winter 'round the ruined mill\The creek is lying flat and still\It is water though it's frozen\So, across the years and miles and through\On a good day you can feel my love for you\Will you leave me be so that we can stay true\To the path that you have chosen?"
Baby Birch	Joanna Newsom	"This is the song for Baby Birch\Though I will never know you\And at the back of what we've done\There is the knowledge of you\Well I wish we could take every path\Could spend a hundred years adoring you\Yes I wish we could take every path\Cause you know I hated to close the door on you\Do you remember staring up at the stars?\So far away in their bullet-proof cars\We heard the rushing, slow intake\Of the dark, dark water and the engine brakes\And I said how about them engine brakes?\And if I should die before I wake\Will you keep an eye on baby birch?\Because I'd hate to see her make the same mistake\When it was dark I called and you came\When it was dark I saw shapes\When I see stars I feel your hand\And I see stars and I reel again\Well mercy me, I'll be goddamned!\It's been a long, long time since I last saw you\And I have never known the plan\It's been a long, long, time.  How are you?\Your eyes are green, your hair is gold\Your hair is black, your eyes are blue\I closed the ranks and I doubled back\But you know I hated to close the doggone door on you\We take a walk along the dirty lake\Hear the goose cussing at me over her eggs\You poor little cousin, I don't want your dregs\A little baby fussing over my legs\There is a blacksmith and there is a shepherd and there is a butcher boy\And there is a barber who's cutting and cutting away at my only joy\I saw a rabbit as slick as a knife and as pale as a candlestick\And I had thought it'd be harder to do but I caught her and skinned her quick, held her there\Kicking and mewling upended unspooling unsung and blue\Told her wherever you go little runaway bunny I will find you\And then she ran\As they're liable to do\Be at peace baby, and be gone\Be at peace baby, and be gone"
'81	Joanna Newsom	"I found a little plot of land\In the Garden of Eden\It was dirt and dirt is all the same\I tilled it with my two hands\And I called it my very own;\There was no one to dispute my claim\Well, you'd be shocked\At the state of things--\The whole place\Had just cleared right out\It was hotter than hell\So I laid me by a spring, for a spell\As naked as a trout\The wandering eye that I have caught\Is as hot as a wandering sun\But I will want for nothing more\In my garden:\Start again\In my hardening to every heart but one\Meet me in the garden of Eden\Bring a friend\We are going to have ourselves a time\We are gonna have a garden party\It's on me!\No, sirree, it's my dime\We broke our hearts\In the war between\St. George and the dragon\But both, in equal part\Are welcome to come along\I’m inviting everyone\Farewell to loves that I have known\Even muddiest waters run\Tell me. What is meant but sin, or none\In a garden\Seceded from the union\In the year of A.D. 1?\The unending amends you've made\Are enough for one life\Be done\I believe in innocence, little darlin'\Start again\I believe in everyone\I believe, regardless\I believe in everyone"

Ribbon Bows	Joanna Newsom	"There is a spring, not far from here\The water runs both sweet and clear —\Both sweet and clear, and cold:\Could crack your bones\With veins of gold\I stood, a-wagging, at the tap;\Just a-waiting on the lagging, rising sap\I held the cold tin ladle to my lip\At the Shrine of the Thousand Arms\I lowered my eyes to sip\What a beautiful day to catch my drift\Or be caught up in it\You want your love, Love?\Come and get your love;\I only took it back\Because I thought you didn't\How my ears did ring\At the municipal pound\From that old hangdog\To which I was bound:\Curled 'round the bottom rung —\Doesn't anybody want you?\Well, come on, darlin\I could use someone like you around\I am not like you, I ain't from this place\And I do reserve the right\To repeat all my same mistakes\And, in the night, like you\I certainly bite and chew\What I can find\And never seem to lose the taste\What a horrible face I feel me make —\For Pete's sake\What you have told me, I cannot erase! —\(Though I keep on saying\And I do believe, it is not too late)\All day, you're hassling me with trifles:\Black nose of the dog, as cold as a rifle\Indicating, with a nudge\God, No God. God, No God\Sweet, appraising eye of the dog\Blink once if god\Twice if no god\My mama may be ashamed of me\With all of my finery:\Carrying on\Whooping it up till the early morn\Lost and lorn\Among the madding revelry!\Sure, I can pass\Honey, I can pass\Particularly when I start to tip my glass\I'll be a sport\And have a go at that old song\Singing unabashed, about\'Them city girls\With their ribbon bows\And their fancy sash...'\But, though I get so sad\(could swear the night\Makes a motion to claim me\Around that second verse)\I reckon I've felt worse\And still held fast\But, later on, when I am alone\Alone at last\Well I take my god to task\I take my god to task"
Jackrabbits	Joanna Newsom	"I was tired of being drunk\My face cracked like a joke\So I swung through here like a brace of jackrabbits\With their necks all broke\I stumbled at the door with my boot\And I knocked against the jamb\And I scrabbled at your chest like a mute\With my fists of ham\Trying to tell you that I am\Telling you I can\I can love you again\Love you again\I'm squinting towards the East\My faith makes me a dope\But you can take my hand in the darkness, darling\Like a length of rope\I shaped up overnight, you know\The day after she died\When I saw my heart, and I tell you, darling\It was open wide\What with telling you I am\Telling I can\I can love you again\Love you again\And it can have no bounds, you know\It can have no end\But you can take my hand in the darkness, darling\When you need a friend\And it can change in shape and form\But never change in size\Well, the water, it runs deep, my darling\Where it don't run wide\The feather of a hawk was bound\Bound around my neck\A poultice made of fig\The eager little vultures peck\And the verse I read in jest\In Matthew spoke to me\Said, there's a flame that moves like a low-down pest\That says, "you will be free"\Only tell me that I can\Tell me that I can\I can love you again\Love you again\Love you again\Love you"
Kingfisher	Joanna Newsom	"Whose is the hand that I will hold?\Whose is the face I will see?\Whose is the name that I will call\When I am called to meet thee?\In this life who did you love\Beneath the drifting ashes?\Beneath the sheeting banks of air\That barrenly bore our rations?\When I could speak it was too late\Didn't you hear me calling?\Didn't you see my heart leap like\A pup in the constant barley?\In this new life where did you crouch\When the sky had set to boiling?\Burning within, seen from without\And your gut was a serpent coiling\And for the sake of that pit of snakes\For whom did you allay your shyness?\And spend all your mercy and madness and grace\In a day beneath the bending cypress\It was not on principle\Show, pro-heart that you have got gall\A miracle\I can bear a lot but not that pall\I can bear a lot, but not that pall\Kingfisher sound the alarm\Say sweet little darling now come to my arms\Tell me all about the love you left on the farm\He was a kind, unhurried man\With a heavy lip and a steady hand\But he loved me just like a little child\Like a little child loves a little lamb\Thrown to the ground by something down there\Bitten by the bad air while the clouds tick\Trying to read all the signs\Preparing for when the bombs hit\Hung from the underbelly of the earth\While the stars skid away below\Gormless and brakeless, gravel-loose\Falling silent as gavels in the snow\I lay back and spit in my chaw\Wrapped in the long arm of the law\Who has seen it all\I can bear a lot but not that pall\I can bear a lot but not that pall\Kingfisher, cast your fly\O lord, it happens without even trying\When I sling a low look from my shuttering eye\Blows rain upon the one you loved\And though you were only sparring\There's blood on the eye, unlace the glove\Say, honey, I am not sorry\Stand here and name the one you loved\Beneath the drifting ashes\And in naming, rise above time\As it, flashing, passes\We came by the boatload\And were immobilized\Worshiping volcanoes\Charting the loping skies\The tides of the earth left\Us bound and calcified and made as\Obstinate as obsidian\Unmoving, save our eyes\Just mooning and blinking\From faces marked with coal\Ash cooling and shrinking\Cracks loud as thunder rolling, I swear\I know you; you know me\Where have we met before, tell me true?\To whose authority\Do you consign your soul?\I had a dream you came to me\Saying, you shall not do me harm anymore\And with your knife you evicted my life\From its little lighthouse on the seashore\And I saw that my blood had no bounds\Spreading in a circle like an atom bomb\Soaking and felling everything in its path\And welling in my heart like a birdbath\It is too short, the day we are born\We commence with our dying\Trying to serve with the heart of a child\Kingfisher lie with the lion"

Cassiopeia	Joanna Newsom	"Feel the matress tense beneath me\Like the muscle of nonsleepy\Feathers flexing will defeat me\And it vexes me completely\And the hexes heat covertly\Like a slow low-flying turkey\Like a Texan drying jerky\But his meaty mitts can't hurt me\With my steely will compounded\In a mighty mound that's hounded\By the snap my steel string sounded\Just before your snores unwound it\And in store are dreams so daring\That the night can't stop from staring\I'll swim sweetly as a herring\Through the ether, not despairing\Go to sleep, you stunning sky\Gently creep cunning by\A quiet hum is amplified\By your thumb\That you suck dry\Hundred raging waters snare the lonely sigh\Hold your breath and clasp at Cassiopiea\Hundred raging waters snare the lonely sigh\Hold your breath and clasp at Cassiopiea\Cassiopiea, Cassiopiea\Oh oh, Cassiopiea"

Maybe, spiritual hero who appears in you\To clear your view when you're too crazy\Lifeless to those, the definition for what life is\Priceless to you because I put you on the hype shit\You like it? Gun smokin', righteous with one toke\Psychic among those, possess you with one go\I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad\I got sunshine in a bag\I'm useless, but not for long\The future is coming on\I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad\I got sunshine in a bag\I'm useless, but not for long\The future is coming on\It's coming on, it's coming on\It's coming on, it's coming on\It's coming on…\The essence, the basics, without it, you naked\Allow me to make this, childlike in nature\Rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy\I'm in them, every sprouting tree, every child of peace\Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes\I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise\From this fucking enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies\Through Russel, not his muscles\But the percussion he provides with me as a guide\Y'all can see me now, 'cause you don't see with your eye\You perceive with your mind; that's the inner\So I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor\Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember\Where the thought is, I brought all this\So you can survive when law is lawless\Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead\No squealing, remember that it's all in your head\I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad\I got sunshine in a bag\I'm useless, but not for long\The future is coming on\I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad\I got sunshine in a bag\I'm useless, but not for long\The future is coming on\It's coming on, it's coming on\It's coming on, it's coming on\It's coming on…"

Sound in Gate	Versailles	"When the curch bell rang you should've come back to your sences\The thing you saw between the sword pointing east and the sword pointing west was his memory\Whilst the sun rises above your head and the shade fades away\The key of the heart will appear adn the 13th Gate will be opened\Don't be afraid of the light\Darkness is not born out of darkness\To those who are used to having their heart pierced\You noticed the true feeling of the solitude come straight for the heart\A purification\The modification of a new consciousness\Reincarnation\The glass words and the glass fate\The 13th Gate exists in the past\God Palace"

destined for	T.M.Revolution	"繰り返し降る口吻夢だと言い聞かせた\届かない君が赦した　幻のような愛を\儚く揺らし続けて壊れてゆく想いを見つめて\明日には消える光を　それで構わない　愛しく抱き締めている\何処にいてもいい　忘れ去れずに閉じてゆく季節に\繋ぐのは温もり震えている時が奪い去っても\出逢わなければならない人にきっともう会ったんだから\その羽根が造り物でも　背負いたい人は居て\キレイなら高く翔べたら　　切ないこの街で　誰かに愛されるかと\傷ついたまま　守り続ける　優しさを教えて\それぞれの違った淋しさから　僕らは僕らへと\変わってゆくんだ　誰もが　その痛みの　命じるままに\何処にいてもいいと　思ったから　与えてくれたから\歩いてゆける　僕なら　この痛みの　命じるままに\鮮やかな移ろい　近付いてる時が奪い去っても\出逢わなければ　ならない人に　きっともう　会ったんだから"

Carolyna	Melanie C	"Just another girl with a dream in her heart\Wanna make a new start with a fire inside of her\She had to go\She couldn't stay around, everybody let her down\Stole the light and the life and the child inside of her\She's so alone\Running for the train\Take her far away from everything she knows\And the way they make her feel\She leaves today\Never look back never lose track already strong\She's seen too much at seventeen\The past will fade with the future that she craves\Carolyna you travel so far\Trying to escape the pain, start again where you are\Carolyna you keep following your star\Nobody said you're beautiful, you're beautiful the way you are\Finally you're free where you long to be\But it won't take long till hits reality\The streets are cold\Big, bad city gonna eat you up\Hard to survive, hard to keep your sanity\Still feeling low\But she's never going home\Carolyna you travel so far\Trying to escape the pain, start again where you are\Carolyna you keep following your star\Nobody said you're beautiful, you're beautiful the way you are\She tries to rest\All she needs is a warm caress\All she wants is happiness\Carolyna you travel so far\Trying to escape the pain, start again where you are\Carolyna you keep following your star\Nobody said you're beautiful, you're beautiful the way you are\So beautiful the way you are\So beautiful the way you are\Carolyna you travel so far\Trying to escape the pain, start again where you are\Carolyna you keep following your star\Nobody said you're beautiful, you're beautiful the way you are\Carolyna"

Lights and Sounds	Yellowcard	"Hello you, how was the rest?\You made it through but nevertheless\I got you out on a wire\You be love and I'll be a liar\Tell it all and fill up the air\But make it loud cause nobody's there\Nobody’s there\Nobody’s there\Stop, turn, take a look around\At all the lights and sounds\Let them bring you in\Slow burn, let it all fade out\Pull the curtain down\And wonder where you’ve been\Make it new but stay in the lines\Just let go but keep it inside\Smile big for everyone\Even when you know what they've done\They gave you the end but not where to start\Not how to build, how to tear it apart\So tell it all and fill up the air\But make it loud cause nobody's there\Nobody’s there\ x3\I've got a way to work this out\I've got a way and you know how\I've got a way to work this out\I've got a way and you know how\I've got a way to work this out\I've got a way\You’ve earned everything you’ve found\And painted faces frown\I'll say I knew you when"

AMBER	DIR EN GREY	"小春日和の風は脈打つ　歪んだ音で\崩れた理想　壊れた未来　俺にはもう…\もっと君と居たいけど　もっと傍に居たいけど\笑顔に潜む弱き涙　これ以上は隠せないよ\琥珀色した数年の夢　終焉の先　そこに本当の俺がいる？\耐える事なら死ぬ程したさ　手も差し伸べた　けれど行き着いた俺は今\We're in hell under control of him\終わりを告げる　ライトは消えて舞台は闇\もっと声を聞かせてよ　もっとここに居たいけど\さよなら　心から愛した名前も解らない君よ\琥珀色した約束の地で　小春日和の風を背に受けて思い出し\涙は流れ血と混ざりあい　琥珀色した新しい夢が「心」にある\声が枯れるまで最後の…\声が枯れるまで歌おう"

En Gallop!	Joanna Newsom	"This place is damp and ghostly\I am already gone\And the halls were lined with the disembodied\And dustly wings, which fell from flesh\Gasplessly\And I go where the trees go\And I walk from a higher education\For now and for hire\It beats me, but I do not know\And it beats me but I do not know\It beats me, but I do not know\I do not know\Palaces and storm clouds\The rough, straggly sage\And the smoke\And the way it will all come together\In quietness and in time\And you laws of property\Oh, you free economy\And you unending afterthoughts\You could've told me before\Never get so attached to a poem\You forget truth that lacks lyricism\Never draw so close to the heat\That you forget that you must eat, oh..."
Eternal Sunshine	Jhené Aiko	"Is it strange for me to say that if I were to die today\There's not a thing that I would change, I've lived well\Maybe I have made mistakes and been through my fair share of pain\But all in all, it's been okay, I've lived well\And the more that I see, the more that I know\I don't know anything at all\Like the more that I breathe and start to go slow\Of all the many things, I can only recall\All of the good things, good things\All of the good things, good things\Only the good, the good, the good\Only the good, the good, the good\All of the good things, good things\All of the good things, good things\Only the good, the good, the good\Only the good\Living on Sycamore Street and spending weekends on the beach\We were free to be everything we dreamed\Flying kites and water fights\Summer nights, we'd ride our bikes\On Overhill, Ladera Heights\Man, I swear\The more that I see, the more that I know\I don't know anything at all\And the more that I breathe and start to go slow\Of all the many things, I can only recall\All of the good things, good things\All of the good things, good things\Only the good, the good, the good\Only the good, the good, the good\All of the good things, good things\All of the good things, good things\Only the good, the good, the good\Only the good, the good, the good\All of the good things, good things\All of the good things, good things\Only the good, the good, the good\Only the good"

What Hurts the Most	Rascal Flatts	"I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house\That don’t bother me\I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out\I’m not a-\-raid to cry every once in a while\Even though going on with you gone still upsets me\There are days every now and again I pretend I’m OK\But that’s not what gets me\What hurts the most\Was being so close\And having so much to say\And watching you walk away\And never knowing\What could have been\And not seeing that loving you\Is what I was tryin’ to do\It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go\But I’m doin’ It\It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone\Still harder\Getting up, getting dressed, livin’ with this regret\But I know if I could do it over\I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart\That I left unspoken\What hurts the most\Is being so close\And having so much to say much to say\And watching you walk away\And never knowing\What could have been\And not seeing that loving you\Is what I was trying to do, oh\What hurts the most\Is being so close\And having so much to say (much to say)\And watching you walk away\And never knowing\What could have been\And not seeing that loving you\Is what I was trying to do, oh\Not seeing that loving you\That’s what I was trying to do"

Burnout	Green Day	"I declare I don't care no more\I'm burning up and out and growing bored\In my smoked out boring room\My hair is shagging in my eyes\Dragging my feet to hit the street tonight\To drive along these shit town lights\I'm not growing up\I'm just burning out\And I stepped in line\To walk amongst the dead\Apathy has rained on me\Now I'm feeling like a soggy dream\So close to drowning but I don't mind\I've lived inside this mental cave\Throw my emotions in the grave\Hell, who needs them anyway\I'm not growing up\I'm just burning out\And I stepped in line\To walk amongst the dead"

Floods of tears	L'Arc~en~Ciel	"瓦礫の中たたずむ者は\誰もが黙って空を見上げている\哀しい色の雲が雨の訪れを伝え\やがて私に降りそそぐ\信じている気持ちが雨に流されそうで\思い出に身を移す\子供達は気にも止めず雨を従えて\恐れず明日を夢見ている\目の前でくり返す裏切りの答え\深く沈む情景に立ち尽くす\何も見えない　重ねた信実も\何も見えない　あなたが居るのかさえ\ー盲目なその想いは崩れて\空しく運命に刻み付けるー\何も見えない……\途切れた糸が何処か\涙に震えながら手さぐりで探している"

Bye bye”)\I have to block out thoughts of you so I don’t lose my head\They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed\Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I’m alone\Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home\There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain\An ounce of peace is all I want for you; will you never call again?\And will you never say that you loved me just to put it in my face?\And will you never try to reach me?\It is I that wanted space\Hate me today\Hate me tomorrow\Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you\Hate me in ways\Yeah, ways hard to swallow\Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you\I’m sober now for 3 whole months\It’s one accomplishment that you helped me with\The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won’t touch again\In a sick way, I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night\While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight\You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate\You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take\So I’ll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind\And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind\And with a sad heart, I say bye to you and wave\Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made\And like a baby boy, I never was a man\Until I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand\And then I fell down yelling, “Make it go away!”\Just make a smile come back and shine just like it used to be\And then she whispered “How can you do this to me?”\For you\For you\For you\If you're sleeping, are you dreaming?\If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me?\I can't believe you actually picked me\Hey, Justin!

Hurt	Christina Aguilera	"Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face\You told me how proud you were but I walked away\If only I knew what I know today\I would hold you in my arms\I would take the pain away\Thank you for all you've done\Forgive all your mistakes\There's nothing I wouldn't do\To hear your voice again\Sometimes I wanna call you but I know you won't be there\Oh, I'm sorry for blaming you\For everything I just couldn't do\And I've hurt myself by hurting you\Some days I feel broke inside but I won't admit\Sometimes I just wanna hide cause it's you I miss\And it's so hard to say goodbye when it comes to this\Would you tell me I was wrong?\Would you help me understand?\Are you looking down upon me?\Are you proud of who I am?\There's nothing I wouldn't do\To have just one more chance\To look into your eyes and see you looking back\Oh, I'm sorry for blaming you\For everything I just couldn't do\And I've hurt myself\If I had just one more day\I would tell you how much that\I've missed you since you've been away\Oh, it's dangerous\It's so out of line\To try and turn back time\Oh, I'm sorry for blaming you\For everything I just couldn't do\And I've hurt myself by hurting you"

Leaving	All Left Out	"Just touched down in a strange new land\A twinkle in my eye\A compass in my open hand\I'm here, a pioneer\I understand, what this all entails\And the hourglass is running out of sand\Check my heading as I depart\Like the beating of a drum\Drum the beating of my hungry heart\I know there's more to go\So make me stop (stop, stop)\I'll do the best I can\Now I'm ready to embark\Leaving is the hardest thing\But when you go you'll be glad you did\Leaving is the hardest thing\But when you go you'll soar like people on wings\Left right left and I'm on my way\A hustle in my step, a hustle really can convey\I'm outdone\I wanna run to reach a place\The place a need to be\So I really should be keeping up the pace\Leaving is the hardest thing\But when you go you'll be glad you did\Leaving is the hardest thing\But when you go you'll soar like people on wings\Surrender\I surrender \Now or never\I surrender\Now or never\(Ah Ah Ah Ah)\Leaving is the hardest thing\But when you go you'll be glad you did\Leaving is the hardest thing\But when you go you'll soar like people on wings\Leaving is the hardest thing\But when you go you'll be glad you did\Leaving is the hardest thing\But when you go you'll soar like people on wings\(Ah Ah Ah Ah)"

Welcome to Paradise	Green Day	"Dear mother, can you hear me whining?\It's been 3 whole weeks\Since that I have left your home\This sudden fear has left me trembling\Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own\And I'm feeling so alone\Pay attention to the cracked streets\And the broken homes\Some call it the slums, some call it nice\I want to take you through a wasteland\I like to call my home\Welcome To Paradise\A gunshot rings out at the station\Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own\It makes me wonder why I'm still here\For some strange reason it's now\Feeling like my home\And I'm never gonna go!\Pay attention to the cracked streets\And the broken homes\Some call it the slums, some call it nice\I want to take you through a wasteland\I like to call my home\Welcome To Paradise\Dear mother, can you hear me laughing?\It's been 6 whole months since\Since that I have left your home\It makes me wonder why I'm still here\For some strange reason it's now\Feeling like my home\And I'm never gonna go!\Pay attention to the cracked streets\And the broken homes\Some call it the slums, some call it nice\I want to take you through a wasteland\I like to call my home\Welcome To Paradise\Paradise"

How to Save a Life	The Fray	"Step one, you say we need to talk\He walks, you say sit down; it's just a talk\He smiles politely back at you\You stare politely right on through\Some sort of window to your right\As he goes left and you stay right\Between the lines of fear and blame\You begin to wonder why you came\Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend\Somewhere along in the bitterness, and\I would have stayed up with you all night\Had I known how to save a life\Let him know that you know best\‘Cause after all, you do know best\Try to slip past his defense\Without granting innocence\Lay down a list of what is wrong\The things you've told him all along\And pray to God he hears you\And pray to God he hears you, and\Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend\Somewhere along in the bitterness, and\I would have stayed up with you all night\Had I known how to save a life\As he begins to raise his voice\You lower yours and grant him one last choice\Drive until you lose the road\Or break with the ones you've followed\He will do one of two things\He will admit to everything\Or he'll say he's just not the same\And you'll begin to wonder why you came\Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend\Somewhere along in the bitterness, and\I would have stayed up with you all night\Had I known how to save a life\Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend\Somewhere along in the bitterness, and\I would have stayed up with you all night\Had I known how to save a life\How to save a life\How to save a life\Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend\Somewhere along in the bitterness, and\I would have stayed up with you all night\Had I known how to save a life\Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend\Somewhere along in the bitterness, and\I would have stayed up with you all night\Had I known how to save a life\How to save a life\How to save a life"

Always I Will Miss You. Always You.	Bike For Three!	"Always, I will miss you, always you\Always, I will miss you, always you\Always, I will miss you, always\Left to our own devices, preciseness\We've made something indestructible and priceless\Lightning is the fury; thunder, the obsession\Hours in between and I'm under the impression\When I heard your music, I tried to dance and fell\Advancing well, but I don't have a chance in hell\Enhance, excel, the darkest night, I should have been there\But every time I come close, you disappear into thin air\I walk a mile through broken fields and bandaged woods\We talk a while, the words are incoherent, I'm damaged goods\I try to work my way down a list of growing factors\But instead, I'm going backwards\There's been an accident; condition stable, intravenous\Holding your hand with the kitchen table in between us\Your perfect hands, I recognize them right away\Your naked truth that will never see the light of day\We speak a secret language explaining scars\Birds in the trees, waterfalls, and flaming stars\All the little things that can take my breath away\Lying to myself, I fake my death today\But why am I doing this?\Why am I doing this? Why?\Leavin' to stay; tomorrow, all hail to it\Blank piece of paper, board with a nail through it\You belong to something else, part of my dreams\Different story, I'm coming apart at the seams\The face you want to know and the mask you touch\I don't know what's worse and I ask too much\Going down on each other and caught in the act\Up against the wall and shot in the back\Two rivers: Similarity and Otherness\Another day in a life that is motherless\Thorn in the side, diamonds adorn the sky\I'm under the impression and I was born to die"

RED...[em]	DIR EN GREY	"In the room, on the red wall hang Rosalyn\And the scent from the petals of the flowers fills the room but you are not here\On the velvet sofa as the dreams that turned to ashes quietly\I watch a local movie. The reason to laugh is seeing you on screen\The moon-shaped lamp still shines red\Goodbye... My to my dearest Vivian-scented girl\The decorations of perfumes in the sink, the black and white picture cries\What you see is everything and there's no reason to that\Cut down your discomfort wings\It's dying on you\Cut down your discomfort wings\To a tomorrow that can't be reached\Children sing the church choir at the newly built church\When ever I walk past it, my heart screams\There's no forgetting the Past, the Present, or the Future\Will only the believers be led to salvation? That's stupid\Why can't we be perfect? Why can't it be?\The merry go round that goes around and around and around has dried you up\I hold in my sweaty hand, a picture of you and an ice pick\Cut down your discomfort wings\Be freer\Cut down your discomfort wings\But keep the door closed"

Love Is a Losing Game	Amy Winehouse	"For you I was a flame\Love is a losing game\Five story fire as you came\Love is a losing game\One I wish I never played\Oh what a mess we made\And now the final frame\Love is a losing game\Played out by the band\Love is a losing hand\More than I could stand\Love is a losing hand\Self professed, profound\'Til the chips were down\Know you're a gambling man\Love is a losing hand\Though I betted blind\Love is a fate resigned\Memories mar my mind\Love, it is a fate resigned\Over futile odds\And laughed at by the gods\And now the final frame\Love is a losing game"
Anything	All Left Out	"So this is what they meant when they said it wouldn't easy\There's something on my mind and I'm trying to find the meaning\We'll see how far I get when I'm making my own decisions\It started as a dream make reality my ambition\I have never seen anything quite like it\I have never been any place quite like this\So far I must admit it's more than I anticipated\How long until we get there?\To rise above the rest and reach a point where we can say it\Not content with staying here\There's oppurtunity to be taken if we can make it\I have never seen anything quite like it\I have never been any place quite like this\I have never seen anything quite like it\I have never been any place quite like this\I have never seen anything\I have never seen anything\I have never seen anything quite like this in my entire life"

Where'd You Go	Fort Minor	"Where'd you go? I miss you so\Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone\She said, "Some days, I feel like shit\Some days, I wanna quit and just be normal for a bit"\I don't understand why you have to always be gone\I get along, but the trips always feel so long\And I find myself trying to stay by the phone\'Cause your voice always helps me not to feel so alone\But I feel like an idiot, working my day around the call\But when I pick up, I don't have much to say\So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up\That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating\Telling you that I've had it with you and your career\Me and the rest of the family here, singing "where'd you go?"\Where'd you go? I miss you so\Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone\Where'd you go? I miss you so\Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone\Please come back home\Come back home, you know, the place where you used to live\Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs\Used to have a little party every Halloween\With candy by the pile, but now\You only stop by every once in a while\Shit, I find myself just filling my time\With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind\I'm doing fine, and I'm I planning to keep it that way\You can call me if you find you have something to say\And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up\That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating\Telling you that I've had it with you and your career\Me and the rest of the family here, singing "where'd you go?"\Where'd you go? I miss you so\Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone\Where'd you go? I miss you so\Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone\Please come back home\I want you to know it's a little fucked up\That I'm stuck here waiting, no longer debating\Tired of sitting and hating and making these excuses\For why you're not around, and feeling so useless\It seems one thing has been true, all along\You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone\I guess I've had it with you and your career\When you come back, I won't be here and you can sing it\Where'd you go? I miss you so\Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone\Where'd you go? I miss you so\Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone\Please come back home\When you made me that initial batch of songs\I was like, that's the shit, right there\Alright!"
All Around Me	Flyleaf	"My hands are searching for you\My arms are outstretched towards you\I feel you on my fingertips\My tounge dances behind my lips, for you\This fire runs in through my being\Burning I'm not used to seeing you\I'm alive, I'm alive\I can feel you all around me\Thickening the air I'm breathing\Holding on to what I'm feeling\Savoring this heart that's healing\My hands float up above me\And you whisper you love me\And I begin to fade\Into our secret place\The music makes me sway\The angels singing say we are alone with you\I am alone and they are too with you\I'm alive, I'm alive\I can feel you all around me\Thickening the air I'm breathing\Holding on to what I'm feeling\Savoring this heart that's healing\And so I cry\The light is white\And I see you\I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive\I can feel you all around me\Thickening the air I'm breathing\Holding on to what I'm feeling\Savoring this heart that's healing\Take my hand\I give it to you\Now you own me\All I am\You said you would never leave me\I believe you\I believe\I can feel you all around me\Thickening the air I'm breathing\Holding on to what I'm feeling\Savoring this heart that's healed"

Mockingbird	Eminem	""Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now. But hey, what'd Daddy always tell you? Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip! What you cryin' about? You got me."\Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad\When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had\I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh\I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry\'Cause you're scared, I ain't there\Daddy's with you in your prayers\No more crying, wipe them tears\Daddy's here, no more nightmares\We gon' pull together through it\We gon' do it, Lainie—Uncle's crazy, ain't he?\Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it\We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls\When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls\Looking puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusing you\Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news\I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems\The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me\All the things growing up as Daddy that he had to see\Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did\We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me\But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever being\Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers\But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason\I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something\We have no control over, and that's what destiny is\But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep\Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream\Now hush, little baby, don't you cry\Everything's gonna be alright\Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\Daddy's here to hold ya through the night\I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why\We fear how we feel inside\It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright\(Heh, it's funny)\I remember back one year when Daddy had no money\Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree\And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em\I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'\'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job\But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom\And at the time, every house that we lived in\Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block\And your mom was saving money for you in a jar\Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college\Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it\And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart\And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart\Mom and Dad was arguing a lot, so Momma moved back\On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment\And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara\And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD\And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me\But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me\Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it\And you and Lainie were too young to understand it\Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit\And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it\I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand\'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud\Now I'm sittin' in this empty house\Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out\To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now\Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here\Lainie, I'm talking to you too, Daddy's still here\I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?\Sshh! Momma's only gone for the moment\Now hush, little baby, don't you cry\Everything's gonna be alright\Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\Daddy's here to hold ya through the night\I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why\We fear how we feel inside\It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright\And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird\I'ma give you the world\I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you\I'll do anything for you to see you smile\And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine\I'ma break that birdie's neck\I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya\And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad!

You think I'd lay down and die?\Oh, no, not I, I will survive\Oh as long as I know how to love, I know I'm still alive\I've got my life to live, and I've got all my love to give\And I'll survive, I, I , I will survive\It took all my strength not to fall apart\Trying with all my mind to mend  my broken heart\I spent,  so many nights feeling sorry for myself\Oh, I used to cry but now I hold my head up high\And you see me, somebody new\Not that lonely little person still in love with you\Now you come dropping in  expecting me to be free\Now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me\Go on go, walk out the door, turn around now\You're not welcome anymore\You're the one, who tried to hurt me with goodbye?\Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?\Oh, no, not I, I will survive\Long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive\I've got  my life to live, and all my love to give\And I'll survive, I, I , I will survive\Go on go, walk out the door, turn around now\You're not welcome anymore\You're the one, who tried to hurt me with goodbye?\Did you think I'd crumble?

She's a Rebel	Green Day	"She's a rebel, she's a saint\She's the salt of the earth and she's dangerous\She's a rebel, vigilante\Missing link on the brink of destruction\From Chicago to Toronto\She's the one that they call ol' Whatsername\She's the symbol of resistance\And she's holding on my heart like a hand grenade\Is she dreaming what I'm thinking?\Is she the mother of all bombs? Gonna detonate\Is she trouble like I'm trouble?\Make it a double twist of fate or a melody\She sings the revolution\The dawning of our lives\She brings this liberation\That I just can't define\Nothing comes to mind\She's a rebel, she's a saint\She's the salt of the earth and she's dangerous\She's a rebel, vigilante\Missing link on the brink of destruction\She's a rebel\She's a rebel\She's a rebel\And she's dangerous"

But does anyone care?\And if I had the guts to put this to your head\But would anything matter if you're already dead?\And should I be shocked now, by the last thing you said?\Before I pull this trigger, your eyes vacant and stained\But does anyone notice?

But does anyone care?\And if I had the guts to put this to your head\But does anything matter if you're already dead?\And now should I be shocked now, by the last thing you said?\Before I pull this trigger, your eyes vacant and stained\And in saying you loved me made things harder, at best\And these words changing nothing as your body remains\And there's no room in this Hell, there's no room in the next\But does anyone notice there's a corpse in this bed?"

Greener With the Scenery	The Used	"You took it back\How could you go and do something like that\My fingernail phase\Worst has got the best of you\I ask you and I know I need to change, change\You took it back\You ripped my heart out of my, then you put it back\I'm pulling my hair\I let you just a million times\I love you even though it isn't fair\Round we go, 'round again, circles\Play this game over again\Round we go, 'round again, circles\You took it back\You ripped my heart out of my, then you put it back\I'm pulling my hair\I let you just a million times\I love you even though it isn't fair\Round we go, 'round again, circles\Play this game over again\Round we go, 'round again, circles\You took it back\You took it back\Round we go, 'round again, circles\Play this game over again\Round we go, 'round again, circles, circles"
Bulimic	The Used	"From the way that you acted\To the way that I felt it\It wasn't worth my time\And now it's sad cause all I missed\Wasn't that good to begin with\And now I've started you begging\Saying things that you don't mean\It isn't worth my time\A line's a dime a million times\And I'm about to see all of them\ x3\Goodbye to you, goodbye to you\You're taking up my time\You call my name when I wake up\To see things go your way\I'm coughing up my time\Each drag's a drop of blood, a grain\A minute of my life\It's all I've got just to stay down\Why the fuck am I still down?\I'm hoarding all that's mine\Each time I let just one slip by\I'm wasting what is mine\My time x3\ x2\I’m about to see a million things\I thought I’d never seen before and I\I’m about to do all of the things I've dreamed of\And I don’t even miss you at all (Fuck you!)\ x7"

My sadness is not cured\I tore off a single damp petal from a hydrangea\It floats in a puddle, and I remember you\In the evening just after the rain, I faintly heard the far off whistel of a ship\For some reason, it made me sad\If I can't be forgiven, then everything can disappear\The sadness and the pain, to the world that doesn't need anything\I lock myself up, unable to even atone\I can't do anything but pray... My sadness is not cured\From the gently crying sky, I also heard your voice\I laughed through gathering tears, but I couldn't see anything...\Inside of the light, I saw my youthful memories\Even the soundless smile is happy right now\I can't return to that time ever again\When we were laughing"

Heavenly Star	Genki Rockets	"I hear you whispering surrounded in silence\Blue vibration\I hear the waves singing in the distance\Pure isolation\I smile into the distance far away from you\We're in resolution\Dreaming, touching, breathing side by side\Dive into the sky\Let's get away, fly away\I found the path to paradise\Shining spiral of gold\Take my hand, find our way out\Heavenly stars above\Just believe what's in your heart\No border between us!!\I can always feel you inside\Wherever we are\I see you, feel you, I'm your creation\Everlasting affection\Life's an endless spiral going round\Yes! We are in love\Let's get away, fly away\I found the path to paradise\Shining spiral of gold\Take my hand, find our way out\Heavenly stars above\Just believe what's in your heart\No border between us\I can always feel you inside\Wherever we are\Let's get away, fly away\I'm feeling raindrops on my face\Sun shines through the clouds, yeah\Rainbow all around us\I spread my wings, fly away\The wind sweeps me off my feet\Blowing me away, yeah\Trees whispering to me\I'm feeling free now\Let's get away, fly away!!\I found the path to paradise\Shining spiral of gold\Take my hand, find our way out\Heavenly stars above\Just believe what's in your heart\No border between us!!\I can always feel you inside\Wherever we are"

All I Want for Christmas Is You	My Chemical Romance	"I don't want a lot for Christmas\There is just one thing I need\I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree\I just want you for my own\More than you could ever know\Make my wish come true\Baby all I want for Christmas is you\I don't want a lot for Christmas there is just one thing I need\And I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree\I don't need to hang my stocking way above the fireplace\Santa Clause won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas day\And I just want you for my own\More than you could ever know\Make my wish come true\Oh baby all I want for Christmas is you, you baby\I won't ask for much this Christmas\I won't even wish oh I won't even wish. I won't even wish for snow\I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe\I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for St Nick\Won't even stay awake to hear the magic reindeer play\Cause I just want you here tonight\Holdin on to me so tight\What more can I do\Oh baby all I want for Christmas is you, oh baby\Oh our lives are shinin surrounding everywhere\Where the sounds of children's laughter fills the air\And everyone is singin' oh I hear those sleigh bells ringin'\Santa won't you bring me the one I really need\Won't you bring back my baby to me\Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas\This is all I'm askin for\I just want to see my baby standing right outside my door\I just want you for my own\More than you could ever know\Make my wish come true\All I want for Christmas is you, you, its you, you, oh baby\All I want is you \You, you, you, you, you"

Blood	My Chemical Romance	"Well, they encourage your complete cooperation\Send you roses when they think you need to smile\I can't control myself because I don't know how\And they love me for it, honestly, I'll be here for a while\So give them blood, blood, gallons of the stuff!\Give them all that they can drink and it will never be enough\So give them blood, blood, blood\Grab a glass because there's going to be a flood\A celebrated man amongst the gurneys\They can fix me proper with a bit of luck\The doctors and the nurses they adore me so\But it's really quite alarming cause I'm such an awful fuck\(Oh thank you)\I gave you blood, blood, gallons of the stuff\I gave you all that you can drink and it has never been enough\I gave you blood, blood, blood\I'm the kind of human wreckage that you love"
