This Is How I Disappear	My Chemical Romance	"Go!\\To un-explain the unforgivable\Drain all the blood and give the kids a show\By streetlight this dark night\A séance down below\There's things that I have done\You never should ever know\\And without you is how I disappear\And live my life alone forever now\And without you is how I disappear\And live my life alone forever now\\Who walks among the famous living dead\Drowns all the boys and girls inside your bed\And if you could talk to me\Tell me if it's so\That all the good girls go to heaven\Well, heaven knows\\That without you is how I disappear\And live my life alone forever now\And without you is how I disappear\And live my life alone forever now\\Can you hear me cry out to you?\Words I thought I'd choke on, figure out\I'm really not so with you anymore\I'm just a ghost\So I can't hurt you anymore\So I can't hurt you anymore\\And now, you wanna see how far down I can sink?\Let me go, fuck!\So you can\Well, now, so you can\I'm so far away from you\Well, now, so you can\\And without you is how I disappear\And without you is how I disappear\Forever, forever now"
Red Sky	Thrice	"I know what lies beneath\I've seen the flash of teeth\Conspiring with the reef\To sink our ship\The wind's a cheating wife\Her tongue a thirsty knife\And she could take your life\With one good kiss\\Can you see the sky turn red\As morning's light breaks over me?\Know tonight we'll make our bed\At the bottom of the sea\\I know the ocean speaks\I've heard her call to me\And smiling in my dreams\She whispers this:\("The stars retreat behind their veil\The clouds are clinging to your sail\The storm is coming, can you see?")\\Can you see the sky turn red\As morning's light breaks over me?\Know tonight we'll make our bed\At the bottom of the sea\\Look and see the sky turn red\Like blood it covers over me\And soon the sea shall give up her dead\We'll raise an empire from the bottom of the sea"

E Is For Estranged	Owen Pallett	"I think that 80% of a good show is rooted in humiliation\\Boys run like water from the barrel to the trough\They'll never stop their running\Gunning for their brothers\This house is a hostel\It is peaceful, but it's always emptying\Boys all want to be someone\\Haven't you heard? I am a flightless bird\I am a liar, feeding facts to a false fire\If pathos is borne, borne out of bullshit\In formal attire, I'll score you a string ensemble\\I saw my son at seventeen\The shutters made projections on his naked frame\And now at twenty-five\He simply cannot stay away from the ketamine\With makeup on his sores\He spends an hour a day composing little eulogies\Sometimes he sends me letters\But they're mostly garbled phrases and apologies\\But haven't you heard? I am a flightless bird\I am a liar, feeding facts to a false fire\If pathos is borne, borne out of bullshit\In formal attire, cue the Bulgarian men's choir"

Emily	Joanna Newsom	"The meadowlark and the chim-choo-ree and the sparrow\Set to the sky in a flying spree, for the sport of the pharaoh\Little while later the Pharisees dragged a comb through the meadow\Do you remember what they called up to you and me, in our window?\There is a rusty light on the pines tonight\Sun pouring wine, lord, or marrow\Down into the bones of the birches\And the spires of the churches\Jutting out from the shadows\The yoke, and the axe, and the old smokestacks and the bale and the barrow\And everything sloped like it was dragged from a rope\In the mouth of the south below\We've seen those mountains kneeling, felten and grey\We thought our very hearts would up and melt away\From that snow in the nighttime\Just going\And going\And the stirring of wind chimes\In the morning\In the morning\Helps me find my way back in\From the place where I have been\And, Emily - I saw you last night by the river\I dreamed you were skipping little stones across the surface of the water\Frowning at the angle where they were lost, and slipped under forever\In a mud-cloud, mica-spangled, like the sky'd been breathing on a mirror\Anyhow - I sat by your side, by the water\You taught me the names of the stars overhead that I wrote down in my ledger\Though all I knew of the rote universe were those Pleiades loosed in December\I promised you I'd set them to verse so I'd always remember\\That the meteorite is a source of the light\And the meteor's just what we see\And the meteoroid is a stone that's devoid of the fire that propelled it to thee\And the meteorite’s just what causes the light\And the meteor’s how it’s perceived\And the meteoroid’s a bone thrown from the void\That lies quiet and offering to thee\\You came and lay a cold compress upon the mess I'm in\Threw the window wide and cried, "Amen! Amen! Amen!"\The whole world stopped to hear you hollering\You looked down and saw now what was happening\The lines are fading in my kingdom\(Though I have never known the way to border them in)\So the muddy mouths of baboons and sows and the grouse and the horse and the hen\Grope at the gate of the looming lake that was once a tidy pen\And the mail is late and the great estates are not lit from within\The talk in town's becoming downright sickening\In due time we will see the far buttes lit by a flare\I've seen your bravery, and I will follow you there\And row through the nighttime\Gone healthy\Gone healthy all of a sudden\In search of the midwife\Who could help me\Who could help me\Help me find my way back in\There are worries where I've been\Say, say, say in the lee of the bay; don't be bothered\Leave your troubles here where the tugboats shear the water from the water\(Flanked by furrows, curling back, like a match held up to a newspaper)\Emily, they'll follow your lead by the letter\And I make this claim, and I'm not ashamed to say I know you better\What they've seen is just a beam of your sun that banishes winter\Let us go! Though we know it's a hopeless endeavor\The ties that bind, they are barbed and spined and hold us close forever\Though there is nothing would help me come to grips with a sky that is gaping and yawning\There is a song I woke with on my lips as you sailed your great ship towards the morning\Come on home, the poppies are all grown knee-deep by now\Blossoms all have fallen, and the pollen ruins the plow\Peonies nod in the breeze and while they wetly bow\With hydrocephalitic listlessness ants mop up-a their brow\And everything with wings is restless, aimless, drunk and dour\The butterflies and birds collide at hot, ungodly hours\And my clay-colored motherlessness rangily reclines\Come on home, now! All my bones are dolorous with vines\Pa pointed out to me, for the hundredth time tonight\The way the ladle leads to a dirt-red bullet of light\Squint skyward and listen\Loving him, we move within his borders\Just asterisms in the stars' set order\We could stand for a century\Staring\With our heads cocked\In the broad daylight at this thing\Joy\Landlocked\In bodies that don't keep\Dumbstruck with the sweetness of being\Until we don't be told\Take this\Eat this\Told"

Between The End And Where We Lie	Thrice	"Is this everything, I've dreamed of so much more, between the end and where we lie\Here all hopes and dreams are scavenged from the floor and fed into machines that feed on vacant eyes\All of my dreams, always find me far beyond these fake fluorescent skies\I know there must be something more, if I could only find the door, then I could free myself and see the world outside\Where Daylight breaks on you and shines into the grey that sleeps beneath your skull\Daylight breaks on you and burns away the grey that suffocates your soul\For now I hold a key, and though I may be lost, I know that I will find my way\I search endlessly but every time I've thought that I was near, the smoke and mirrors lead me astray\See the pit boss, steal each tick tock, time it seems will suffer at our hands\I look for exits in the haze, the dense electric twilit maze, I've heard that there is one that leads to sunlit lands where\Daylight, they tell me that it's just a myth\Daylight, they tell me that it can't exist\They try to betray me with a kiss\They might never know just what they've missed as\Daylight pours fire into my gray eyes\Pour grace into my gray life\Breaks in and lights the way\I can't live without the day"

Only Skin	Joanna Newsom	"And there was a booming above you\That night black airplanes flew over the sea\And they were lowing and shifting like\Beached whales\Shelled snails\As you strained and you squinted to see\The retreat of their hairless and blind cavalry\You froze in your sand shoal\Prayed for your poor soul;\Sky seemed a bread roll, soaking in a milk-bowl\And when the bread broke —\Fell in bricks of wet smoke —\My sleeping heart woke, and my waking heart spoke\Then there was a silence you took to mean something:\Mean, Run, sing\For alive you will evermore be\And the plague of the greasy black engines a-skulking\Has gone east\While you’re left to explain them to me —\Released\From their hairless and blind cavalry\With your hands in your pockets\Stubbily running\To where I’m unfresh\Undressed and yawning —\Well, what is this craziness?\This crazy talking?\You caught some small death\When you were sleepwalking\It was a dark dream, darlin;\It’s over\The firebreather is beneath the clover\Beneath his breathing there is cold clay, forever:\A toothless hound-dog choking on a feather\But I took my fishing pole (fearing your fever)\Down to the swimming hole, where there grows a bitter herb\That blooms but one day a year, by the riverside —\I’d bring it here:\Apply it gently\To the love you’ve lent me\While the river was twisting and braiding, the bait bobbed\And the string sobbed\As it cut through the hustling breeze\And I watched how the water was kneading so neatly\Gone treacly\Nearly slowed to a stop in this heat;\Frenzy coiling flush along the muscles beneath\Press on me\We are restless things\Webs of seaweed are swaddling\You call upon the dusk of the\Musk of a squid:\Shot full of ink, until you sink into your crib\Rowing along, among the reeds, among the rushes\I heard your song, before my heart had time to hush it!\Smell of a stonefruit being cut and being opened\Smell of a low and of a lazy cinder smoking\And when the fire moves away\Fire moves away, son\Why would you say\I was the last one?\Scrape your knee: it is only skin\Makes the sound of violins\When I cut your hair, and leave the birds all the trimmings\I am the happiest woman among all women\And the shallow water stretches as far as I can see\Knee deep, trudging along —\The seagull weeps ‘so long’ —\I’m humming a threshing song —\Until the night is over, hold on\Hold on;\Hold your horses back from the fickle dawn\I have got some business out at the edge of town\Candy weighing both of my pockets down\Till I can hardly stay afloat, from the weight of them\(and knowing how the commonfolk condemn\What it is I do, to you, to keep you warm:\Being a woman. Being a woman.)\But always up the mountainside you’re clambering\Groping blindly, hungry for anything;\Picking through your pocket linings —\Well, what is this?\Scrap of sassafras, eh Sisyphus?\I see the blossoms broke and wet after the rain\Little sister, he will be back again\I have washed a thousand spiders down the drain\Spiders’ ghosts hang, soaked and dangling\Silently from all the blooming cherry trees\In tiny nooses, safe from everyone —\Nothing but a nuisance; gone now, dead and done —\Be a woman. Be a woman\Though we felt the spray of the waves\We decided to stay, 'till the tide rose too far\We weren’t afraid, cause we know what you are;\And you know that we know what you are\Awful atoll —\O, incalculable indiscreetness and sorrow!\Bawl bellow:\Sibyl sea-cow, all done up in a bow\Toddle and roll;\Teethe an impalpable bit of leather\While yarrow, heather and hollyhock\Awkwardly molt along the shore\Are you mine?\My heart?\Mine anymore?\Stay with me for awhile\That’s an awfully real gun\I know life will lay you down\As the lightning has lately done\Failing this, failing this\Follow me, my sweetest friend\To see what you anointed\In pointing your gun there\Lay it down! Nice and slow!\There is nowhere to go\Save up;\Up where the light, undiluted, is\Weaving, in a drunk dream\At the sight of my baby, out back:\Back on the patio\Watching the bats bring night in\— while, elsewhere\Estuaries of wax-white\Wend, endlessly, towards seashores unmapped\*\Last week, our picture window\Produced a half-word\Heavy and hollow\Hit by a brown bird\We stood and watched her gape like a rattlesnake\And pant and labor over every intake\I said a sort of prayer for some rare grace\Then thought I ought to take her to a higher place\Said, “dog nor vulture nor cat shall toy with you\And though you die, bird, you will have a fine view.”\Then in my hot hand, she slumped her sick weight\We tramped through the poison oak, heartbroke and inchoate\The dogs were snapping, so you cuffed their collars\While I climbed the tree-house. Then how I hollered!\Cause she’d lain, as still as a stone, in my palm, for a lifetime or two;\Then saw the treetops, cocked her head, and up and flew\(While back in the world that moves, often, according to\The hoarding of these clues\Dogs still run roughly around\Little tufts of finch-down\The cities we passed were a flickering wasteland,\But his hand, in my hand, made them hale and harmless\While down in the lowlands, the crops are all coming;\We have everything\Life is thundering blissful towards death\In a stampede\Of his fumbling green gentleness\You stopped by;\I was all alive\In my doorway, we shucked and jived\And when you wept, I was gone;\See, I got gone when I got wise\But I can’t with certainty say we survived\Then down and down\And down and down\And down and deeper\Stoke, without sound\The blameless flames\You endless sleeper\Through fire below\And fire above\And fire within\Sleep through the things that couldn’t have been\If you hadn’t have been\And when the fire moves away\Fire moves away, son\Why would you say\I was the last one?\All my bones, they are gone, gone, gone\Take my bones, I don’t need none\Cold, cold cupboard, lord, nothing to chew on!\Suck all day on a cherry stone\Dig a little hole not three inches round —\Spit your pit in a hole in the ground\Weep upon the spot for the starving of me!\Till up grows a fine young cherry tree\When the bough breaks, what’ll you make for me?\A little willow cabin to rest on your knee\What’ll I do with a trinket such as this?\Think of your woman, who’s gone to the west\But I’m starving and freezing in my measly old bed!\Then I’ll crawl across the salt flats, to stroke your sweet head\Come across the desert with no shoes on!\I love you truly\Or I love no-one\Fire moves away. Fire moves away, son\Why would you say that I was the last one, last one?\Clear the room! There’s a fire, a fire, a fire\Get going\And I’m going to be right behind you\And if the love of a woman or two, dear\Couldn't move you to such heights\Then all I can do\Is do, my darling, right by you"

Of Dust And Nations	Thrice	"The towers that shoulder your pride\The words you've written in stone\Sand will cover them, sand will cover you\The streets that suffer your name\Your very flesh and your bones\Sand will cover them, sand will cover you\\So put your faith in more than steel\Don't store your treasures up with moth and rust, where thieves break in and steal\Pull the fangs from out your heel\We live in but a shadow of the real\\Step out from time\See the dust of nations\Step out from time\Hear the stars' ovation\Saturn will not sleep until the sand has made us clean\Still we stack our stones and bury what we can\But it all will be undone, and nothing built under the sun\Will ever stand before the endless march of sand\\So put your faith in more than steel\Don't store your treasures up, with moth and rust where thieves break in and steal\Pull the fangs from out your heel\We live in but a shadow of the real"

Soft as Chalk	Joanna Newsom	"So so long ago and so far away\When time was just a line that you fed me when you wanted to stay\We'd talk as soft as chalk till morning came, pale as a pearl\No time, no, no time, now I have got all the time in the world\Say, honey, did you belong to me?\Tell me honey, was your heart at rest\When, darlin, all the mourning doves were howling us\A song of love's oh godawful lawlessness?\Lawlessness\Say, honey, did you belong to me\Tell me honey, did I pass your test\I lay as still as death until the dawn\Whereupon I wrested from y'r godawful lawlessness\Lawlessness\I roam around the tidy grounds of my dappled sanatorium\Coatless I sit amongst the motes adrift and I dote upon my pinesap gum\And the light through the pines in brassy tines lays over me, dim as rum\And thick as molasses, and so time passes\And so, my heart, tomorrow comes\I feel you leaning out back with the crickets\Loyal heart marking the soon-ness, darkness tonight\Still, the mourning doves will summon us their song\Of love's neverdoneing lawlessness\Lawlessness\While over and over: rear up, stand down, lay round\Trying to sound out or guess the reasons\I sleep like a soldier -- without rest\But there is no treason where there is only lawlessness\Lawlessness\In the last week of the last year I was aware\I took a blind shot across the creek at the black bear\When he roused me in the night and left me cowering with my light calling out\Who is there?\Who's there?\Who is there?\I watched you sleep repeating my prayer\You give love a little shove and it becomes terror, and now I am\Calling in a sadness beyond anger and beyond fear\Who is there?\Who's there?\Who is there?\I glare and nod like the character God bearing down upon the houses and lawns\I knew a little bit, but darling, you were it, and darling, now it is long gone\Sweetheart in your clean bright start back there behind a hill and a dell\And a state line or two I'll be thinking of you, yes, I'll be thinking and be wishing you well\We land, I stand, but I wait for the sound of the bell\I have to catch a cab and my bags are at the carousel\And then, Lord, just then, time alone will only tell\You mourning dove"

Have One on Me	Joanna Newsom	"From the courtyard, I floated in\And watched it go down\Heard the cup drop;\Thought, "Well\That's why they keep them around."\The blackguard sat hard, down\With no head on him now\And I felt so bad\Cause I didn't know how\To feel bad enough\To make him proud\By the time you read this\I will be so far away\Daddy longlegs, how in the world\Am I to be expected to stay?\In the night--\In the night, you may hear me call\Pa, stay your hand\And steel your resolve\Stay where you are\So long and tall\Here's Lola--ta da!--to do\Her famous Spider Dance for you!\Lighten up your pockets!\Shake her skirts and scatter, there\A shrieking, six-legged millionaire\With a blight in his sockets\Miss Montez\The Countess of Lansfeld\Appealed to the King of Bavaria\Saying, "Pretty papa\If you are my friend--\Mister daddy longlegs, they are at it again!--\Can I see you?"\Poor Lola! A tarantula's mounting\Countess Lansfeld's\Handsome brassiere\While they all cheer\And the old king fell from grace\While Lola fled\To save face and her career\You caught a fly, floating by\Wait for him to drown in the dust;\Drown in the dust of other flies\Whereby the machine is run\And the deed is done\Heaven has no word\For the way you and your friends\Have treated poor Louis\May god save your poor soul, Lola\(But there is nothing I adore\Apart from that whore's black heart.)\Well, doesn't that just beat all!\Miss Gilbert\Called to Castlemaine\By the silver dollar and the gold glitter!\Well, I've seen lots\But never, in a million years\Would think to see you, here\Though the long road\Begins and ends with you\I cannot seem to make amends\With you, Louis\When we go out\They're bound to see you with me\At night, I walk in the park\With a whip\Between the lines\Of the whispering Jesuits\Who are poisoning you against me\There's a big black spider\Hanging over my door\Can't go anywhere, anymore\Tell me, are you with me?\I called to you, several times\While the change took place\And then arrived, all night\And I died\But all these songs\When you and I are long gone\Will carry on\Mud in your eye\You asked my hand\Hired a band\"In your heart is all that you need;\Ask and you will receive," it is said\I threw my bouquet\And I knocked 'em dead\Bottle of white, bottle of red\Helpless as a child\When you held me in your arms\And I knew that no other\Could ever love me as you loved\But help me! I'm leaving!\I remember everything\Down to the sound of you shaving--\The scrape of your razor\The dully-abrading black hair\That remained\When you clutched at me\That night I came upstairs, half-dead\And, in your kindness\You put me straightaway\In the cupboard\With a bottle of champagne\And then, later, on a train\It was dark out, I was half-dead\I saw a star fall into the sky\Like a chunk of thrown coal\As if god himself spat\Like a cornered rat\I really want you to do this for me\Will you have one on me?\It was dark; I was drunk and half-dead\And we slept, knocking heads\Sitting up in the star-smoking air\Knocking heads like buoys\Don't you worry for me!\Have one on me!\Meanwhile, I will raise my own glass\To how you made me fast\And expendable\And I will drink to your excellent health\And your cruelty\Will you have one on me?\--helpless as a child\When you held me in your arms\And I knew that no other\Could ever love me--\From the courtyard, I floated in\And watched it go down\Heard the cup drop;\Thought, "Well, that's why\They keep them around."\The blackguard sat hard, down\With no head on him now\And I felt so bad\Cause I didn't know how\To feel bad enough\To make him proud\Well daddy longlegs, are you?\Daddy longlegs, are you?\Daddy longlegs, are you proud?"

Bachelorette	Björk	"I'm a fountain of blood\In the shape of a girl\You're the bird on the brim\Hypnotised by the whirl\Drink me, make me feel real\Wet your beak in the stream\Game we're playing is life\Love's a two way dream\\Leave me now, return tonight\Tide will show you the way\If you forget my name\You will go astray\Like a killer whale\Trapped in a bay\\I'm a path of cinders\Burning under your feet\You're the one who walks me\I'm your one way street\I'm a whisper in water\Secret for you to hear\You are the one who grows distant\When I beckon you near\\Leave me now, return tonight\Tide will show you the way\If you forget my name\You will go astray\Like a killer whale\Trapped in a bay\\I'm a tree that grows hearts\One for each that you take\You're the intruder's hand\I'm the branch that you break"
ART OF LIFE	X Japan	"Desert Rose, why do you live alone?\If you are sad, I'll make you leave this life\Are you white, blue or bloody red?\All I can see is drowning in cold grey sand\The winds of time, you knock me to the ground\I'm dying of thirst, I wanna run away\I don't know how to set me free to live\My mind cries out feeling pain\I've been roaming to find myself\How long have I been feeling endless hurt\Falling down, rain flows into my heart\In the pain I'm waiting for you\Can't go back, no place to go back to\Life is lost, flowers fall\If it's all dreams, now wake me up\If it's all real, just kill me\I'm making the wall inside my heart\I don't wanna let my emotions get out\It scares me to look at the world\Don't want to find myself lost in your eyes\I tried to drown my past in grey\I never wanna feel more pain\Ran away from you without saying any words\What I don't wanna lose is love\Through my eyes\Time goes by like tears\My emotion's losing the color of life\Kill my heart\Release all my pain\I'm shouting out louder\Insanity takes hold over me\Turning away from the wall\Nothing I can see\The scream deep inside\Reflecting another person in my heart\He calls me from within\"All existence you see before you must be wiped out:\Dream, Reality, Memories, and Yourself"\I begin to lose control of myself\My lust is so blind, destroys my mind\Nobody can stop my turning to madness\No matter how you try to hold me in your heart\Why do you wanna raise these walls\I don't know the meaning of hatred\My brain gets blown away hearing words of lies\I only want to hold your love\Stab the dolls filled with hate\Wash yourself with their blood\Drive into the raging current of time\Swing your murderous weapon into the belly\"the earth"\Shout and start creating confusion\Shed your blood for pleasure\And what? For love?\What am I supposed to do?\I believe in the madness called "Now"\Past and future prison my heart\Time is blind\But I wanna trace my love on the wall of time\Over pain in my heart\Art of life\Insane blade stabbing dreams\Try to break all truth now\But I can't heal this broken heart in pain\Cannot start to live, Cannot end my life\Keep on cry\Close my eyes\Time breathes I can hear\All love and sadness\Melt in my heart\Dry my tears\Wipe my bloody face\I wanna feel me living my life\Outside my walls\\You can't draw a picture of yesterday, so you're painting your heart with your blood. You can't say "No," only turning the wheel of time with a rope around your neck. You build a wall of morality and take a breath from between the bricks. You make up imaginary enemies and are chased by them. You're trying to commit suicide. You're satisfied with your prologue. Now you're painting your first chapter black. You are putting the scraps of life together and trying to make an asylum for yourself. You're hitting a bell at the edge of the stage. And you are trying to kill me\I believe in the madness called "Now"\Time goes flowing, breaking my heart\Wanna live, can't let my heart kill myself\Still I haven't found what I'm looking for\Art of life\I try to stop myself\But my heart goes to destroy the truth\Tell me why\I want the meaning of my life\Do I try to live?\Do I try to love in my dream?\\\I'm breaking the wall inside my heart\I just wanna let my emotions get out\Nobody can stop my running to freedom\No matter how you try to hold me in your world\Like a doll carried by the flow of time\I sacrificed the present moment for the future\I was in chains of memory half-blinded\Losing my heart, walking in the sea of dreams\Close my eyes\Rose breathes I can hear\All love and sadness melt in my heart\Dry my tears\Wipe my bloody face\I wanna feel me living my life outside my mind\Dreams can make me mad\I can't leave my dream\I can't stop myself\Don't know what I am\What lies are truth?\What truths are lies?\I believe in the madness called "Now"\Time goes flowing, breaking my heart\Wanna live, can't let my heart kill myself\Still I haven't found what I'm looking for\Art of life, I try to stop myself\But my heart goes to destroy the truth\Tell me why, I want the meaning of my life\Do I try to live? Do I try to love?\Art of life, an Eternal Bleeding heart\You never wanna breathe your last\Wanna live, can't let my heart kill myself\Still I'm feeling for a rose is breathing love\In my life"

Мост	Buhar Jerreau	"Очередного фильма роскошная реклама\У входа в музыкальный магазин висит экраном\В нарезанных сюжетах, глаза на мокром месте\Заснято крупным планом - придворные, лестные\В зале магазина музыка играет в грохоте\Песни западных новинок, засилье похоти\Звук тихонько растёт, на подходе к витринам\За спиной смолкает трейлер кинофильма\На глянцевых афишах у прилавка напротив\Фото женщины в полуобороте\Черты лица рекламные, в общей партитуре\Цыганские глаза и греческие скулы\Но среди превратности, роскоши и вздора\В образе обложки случайного альбома\Отвешивает живопись на выступе витрины\А этого достаточно любому магазину\Мост. Шарф. Дождь. Запах.\Зонт. Кисть. Взгляд. Достаточно.\Мост. Шум. Дождь. Запах.\Зонт. Кисть. Шаг. Достаточно.\Один художник около века тому назад\Даму у которой верные, как у собаки глаза\Изобразил в роскошном зелёном платье\И стоило чуть посмотреть мне на неё так на тебе\Вулкан который считался потухшим\Внезапно ожил и теперь переполняет душу\Я никогда не видел в живую, и увижу я навряд ли\Женщину в столь удивительном наряде\Эта одежда не о женской сексуальности\Которой в современности так подобать пытаются\А о женской женственности, где содержания полны\Материнской нежности и верности жены\Не говорю что нет сейчас обличий женственных\Но тех что на картине - не было и нет иных\Музей как обычно пуст, поделиться не с кем\Значит достаточно сделать это в песне\Мост. Шарф. Дождь. Запах.\Зонт. Кисть. Взгляд. Достаточно.\Мост. Шум. Дождь. Запах.\Зонт. Кисть. Шаг. Достаточно.\Я её встретил случайно, в одном из парков\Вы там бываете тоже, точно гуляли когда то\Кормили серых голубей, просто весной или летом\В один из тёплых дней может любовались кем то\Тонкая, юная, смуглая в белых наушниках\Стоит спиной ко мне, от меня в пару шагах\Я прикоснулся к плечам её хрупким и нежным\Увидел взгляд её тот самый добрый, вежливый\Я спросил время, она засмеялась\И я не удержался, пусть и растерянный малость\Затем вдруг внезапно, она взяла мою руку\И потащила куда то, зачем то, почему то\Я не узнал телефон её, адрес, имя\Это не имело значения в контексте той картины\Осталось воспоминание, чудесное милое\И этого достаточно чтобы быть счастливым\Мост. Шарф. Дождь. Запах.\Зонт. Кисть. Взгляд. Достаточно.\Мост. Шум. Дождь. Запах.\Зонт. Кисть. Шаг. Достаточно."

Good Intentions Paving Company	Joanna Newsom	"Twenty miles left to the show\Hello, my old country, Hello\Stars are just beginning to appear\And I have never, in my life\Before been here\And it's my heart, not me\Who cannot drive\At which conclusion you arrived\Watching me sit here, bolt upright\And cry for no good reason\At the Eastering sky\And the tilt of this strange nation\And the will to remain for the duration\(waving the flag\Feeling it drag)\Like a bump on a bump on a log, baby;\Like I'm in a fistfight with the fog, baby;\Step, ball-change, and a pirouette!\And I regret\How I said to you\Honey, just open your heart\When I've got trouble\Even opening a honey jar\And that, right there, is where we are\I've been fessing, double-fast\Addressing questions nobody asked\I'll get this joy off of my chest, at last\And I will love you\Till the noise has long since passed\And I did not mean to shout. Just drive\Just get us out, dead or alive\The road's too long to mention--\Lord, it's something to see!--\Laid down by the\Good Intentions Paving Company\All the way to the thing\We've been playing at, darling\I can see that you're wearing\Your staying-hat, darling\For the time being, all is well\Won't you love me a spell?\This is blindness beyond all conceiving\While, behind us, the road is leaving\And leaving, and falling back\Like a rope gone slack\Well, I saw straightaway\That the lay was steep\But I fell for you, honey\Easy as falling asleep\And that, right there\Is the course I keep\And no amount of talking\Is going to soften the fall\But, like after the rain\Step out of the overhang. That's all\It had a nice ring to it\When the old opry house rang\So, with a solemn auld lang\Syne, sealed, delivered\I sang\And there is hesitation\And it always remains\(concerning you, me\And the rest of the gang)\And in our quiet hour\I feel I see everything\And am in love\With the hook\Upon which everyone hangs\And I know you meant\To show the extent\To which you gave a goddang--\You ranged real hot and real cold\But I'm sold\I am at home on that range\And I do hate to fold\Right here, at the top of my game\When I've been trying\With my whole heart and soul\To stay right here, in the right lane\But it can make you feel over, and old\(Lord, you know it's a shame)\When I only want for you to pull over\And hold me\Till I can't remember my own name"

Pieces	L'Arc~en~Ciel	"泣かないで泣かないで 大切な瞳よ\悲しさにつまずいても真実を見ていてね\そのままのあなたでいて\大好きなその笑顔くもらせてごめんね\祈っても時の流れ速すぎて遠くまで\流されたから戻れなくて\あぁ 穏やかな輝きに彩られ\歳月は夜を夢に変えるみたいだから\目をこらして さあ!\あなたのすぐそばにまた新しい花が生まれて\木もれ日の中で鮮やかに揺れてる\いつまでも見守ってあげたいけどもう大丈夫\優しいその手を待ってる人がいるから顔を上げて\ねぇ 遠い日に恋をしたあの人も\うららかなこの季節愛する人と今\感じてるかな?\あぁ 私のかけらよ力強くはばたいてゆけ\振り返らないで広い海を越えて\たくさんの光がいつの日にもありますように\あなたがいるからこの命は永遠に続いてゆく\あぁ 両手にあふれそうな想い出たち枯れないように\ゆっくり明日をたずねてゆくから\私のかけらよ力強くはばたいてゆけ\振り返らないで広い海を越えて"
LOVE FLIES	L'Arc~en~Ciel	"果てしない君のもとへ\どれくらい近づいただろう\Right side of the dream\Left side of the truth\Show me the way\(make my sense)\The color is singing\溢れる輝きを与えて\(in believing come with me)\叶わぬ世界へ君よ放て\I feel Love flies\Go on Fast awake\Go on Fast awake\幻影が手招いている\最後の愛 引きかえようか\Right side of the soul\Left side of the life\Show me the way\(make my sense)\The color is singing\遠すぎた闇を越え飛び立つ\(in believing come with me)\翼よ高く君へ届け\I feel Love flies\もっとそばに来て…感じていたい\もっと何が欲しいか言って…さぁ！\(make my sense)\The color is singing\Shining rain is overflowing\All in your mind\(in believing come with me)\Look at the skies\…and then I feel I feel Love flies\(you have to make my way)\The color is singing\Shining rain is overflowing\All in your mind\(in believing come with me)\Look at the skies\…and then I feel I feel Love flies\Go on Fast awake\Go on Fast awake"
