    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->

      <div class="col-12 lg">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>I have keeping a record the songs that I've listened to since February 2011. The way I've done this has been through <a href="https://last.fm">Last.fm</a> by a process called scrobbling. <a href="http://spotify.com">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://itunes.com">iTunes</a>, Android (via <a href="https://github.com/tgwizard/sls">Simple Last.fm</a>), and <a href="https://www.foobar2000.org/">foobar2000</a> all support scrobbling so almost all of my listening history is captured.</p>
      
        <p>In this exploration of my music listening history, I used the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a>: Interactive visualization software</li>
          <li><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org">Pandas</a>: Python data analysis tool</li>

        <h2>Listening Frequency</h2>

        <blockquote>Are there any periods when I listen to songs more often?</blockquote>
      
        <p>One of the most obvious things to explore is exactly when I listen to music. Music is a big part of my life and I listen to it quite a lot but it would be interesting to see if there were any trends or patterns.</p>

    <!-- YEARLY -->

        <blockquote>How many songs I listened to each year.</blockquote>

      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-4">

        <h3>Less and less each year</h3>


        <p>In the year 2011-2012, I was in high school. I think this was the peak of my music listening because I associated music with my identity quite a lot back then. Also, since I was still new to using Last.fm, I was more enthusiastic about recording songs.</p>
        
        <p>One hypothesis that I have as to why 2015 onwards is quite a difference to previous years is that midway through 2015, I got into a relationship. A lot of my free time was spent hanging out with my ex.</p>

        <p>Another possible reason is due to the fact that I was in an internship from September 2016-April 2017 and I found myself having less free time. I had to wake up at 5:00 AM and that meant I had to be in bed by 10:00 PM. Not a lot of time to listen to music.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- MONTHLY -->

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-8">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dvozrk6m8/image/upload/v1523317221/Month_All_xeyb8y.png" alt="Monthly">
        <blockquote>How many songs I listen to each month other seven years.</blockquote>

      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-4">

        <h3>Summer Means Doing Things</h3>

        <p>Interestingly, February has a big dip in listens. This could be because February is shorter. If February was 31 days, 3 days over seven years is equal to 21 days of unaccounted music listening.</p>

        <p>Contrary to what I believed, I thought I would listen to more music during the summer because no school. However, I remember that I worked, took summer classes, and/or went on trips that didn't leave a lot of time to listen to music.</p>
      
        <p>The only explanation I have for the large spike in September and October would be the fact that in 2015 I imported a bunch of songs from a second account I had. This inflated the numbers a lot.</p>
      </div>

    <!-- WEEKDATE -->

        <blockquote>How many songs I listen to on a give day of the week.</blockquote>

      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-4">

        <h3>The Sunday Grind is Real</h3>
        
        <p>This graph really surprised me. I don't really know why Tuesdays I don't listen to as much music. What didn't surprise me however was the weekend.</p>

        <p>Saturday is usually when I slack off. Many assignments are usually due Monday so my Sunday is spent busiliy working and nothing else. Monday is when I take a breather from Sunday's hard work and since it's the beginning of a new week, there's not much to do anyway.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-4">

        <h3>Meals are sacred</h3>
        
        <p>This graph made a little more sense to me. From 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM I am usually in class or at work. The rest of the hours, I have more time to spend listening to music.</p>
        
        <p>An exception is meal time. Usually my meals are spent as school, work, or out with other people. Meal time is usually a social activity and to respect that, I don't normally listen to music during those times.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- 2. SPOTIFY -->

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg">
        <h2>The Streaming Era</h2>

        <blockquote>How different are my listening habits before and after I started using Spotify?</blockquote>
      
        <p>Listening to music has changed quite a lot since I started scrobbling. From 2011 to 2013, I largely listened to music that I had downloaded. It wasn't until September 22, 2014 that I signed up for Spotify. Initially I was really resistent to it because the selection of music wasn't that great (not enough Japanese songs).</p>
        
        <p>I'm not quite sure what sparked me to use Spotify more and more but I found that eventually I almost exlusively switched to streaming my music. Due to the nature of the Spotify library, I was curious as to how my listening habits have changed.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-4">

        <h3>The Fall of Japanese Music</h3>

        <p>I predicted that since I started streaming on Spotify, I would listen to less Japanese music. This makes sense due to the fact that Spotify doesn't have an extensive selection of Japanese music (thankfully, it's been getting better).</p>

        <p>Visual kei is an interesting genre that I grew out of. It consisted of androgynous (mostly) Japanese men performing. Think glam bands from the 80's. I don't have high regard for the genre anymore.</p>

        <p>Around 2014, I discovered the Lebanese band <em>Mashour' Leila</em> and they quickly took over my listening, which explains the high climb in ranks.</p>

        <p>I started listening to a lot of more generic pop since I got on to Spotify. This got me thinking as to what exactly constitutes as generic pop.</p>

      </div>

      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-4">

        <h3>The (Continued) Fall of Japanese Music</h3>

        <p>The consoling thing about this graph is the fact that many of my original top three artists are able to stay in the top ten. <em>L'Arc~en~Ciel</em> (<em>L'Arc</em> for short), <em>DIR EN GREY</em>, and <em>Kozi</em> are all Japanese musicians. I consider <em>L'Arc</em> and <em>DIR EN GREY</em> to be my favourite bands so it's fitting that they're still in the running.</p>
        
        <p>Thanks to Spotify, I rediscovered <em>The Strokes</em>. We've all heard the song <em>Last Nite</em> but after I listened to a pet project of the lead singers, I decided to check out <em>The Strokes</em> more in depth. Needless to say, I was immediately hooked.</p>

        <p>I'm convinced that Gwen Stefani's song <em>Cool</em> is the only reason why she is ranking so high. For a couple of years I really found solace in that song when I was feeling down (which was often).</p>

        <h2>Lyrical Themes</h2>

        <blockquote>What different themes are associated with the songs I listen to the most?</blockquote>
      
        <p>The are people who listen to music because of the lyrics and there are people who listen to music because it sounds nice. I'm somewhere in between the two. Due to my love of music in languages other than English (I only know English and a little bit of Tagalog), there are a large number of songs that I listen to purely because of how it sounds.</p>

        <p>However, there are some songs that are in a different language but (thanks to the power of Google), the English translations of the lyrics still speak to me.</p>

        <p>The goal of this section is to see what kind of topics or themes the songs I listen to the most are about.</p>

        <h3>Getting the Lyrics</h3>

        <p>Firstly, I wanted to reduce the scope of songs that I would include in this analysis. I didn't want songs that I've listened to once or twice have a large impact on the results. I decided to only include songs that have at least <strong>10</strong> listens.</p>
        
        <p>The amount of songs was extremely large so I increased the lower limit to <strong>100</strong> listens. This reduced the number of songs to around 500.</p>

        <p>Using the <a href="http://genius.com">Genius</a> API, I went ahead and grabbed lyrics of all of these songs with a simple python script.</p>

        <h3>Breaking Down the Lyrics</h3>

        <p><a href="https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/">Gensim</a> and <a href="https://www.nltk.org">NLTK</a> are extremely handy for this kind of analysis. I used these Python modules to go through each song and break down each word into a root "word" via a method called stemming. This process also includes removing "stop" words or (what I like to call them), useless words like "the", "and", "but", etc.</p>

        <p>An example of stemming:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>spending -> spend</li>
          <li>spends -> spend</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>Unfortunately, I found that something was wrong with this. The most relevant words that were picked out were not English. Instead, the words were Romanized Japanese. Due to this, I had to go back to the original lyrics and remove offending songs.</p>

        <blockquote>A visualization of the different themes the LDA model generated.</blockquote>
      
        <p>For this section, I used LDA (latent Dirichlet allocation) which assigns words to a topics randomly until the probabilities converge.</p>
      
        <p>When using this algorithm I opted for 4 topics with 50 passes. I repeated the algorithm until the graphs resulted in distinct groupings.</p>
      
        <p>The topics and their corresponding words:</p>
      
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Topic 1 (dreams and hope):</strong> dream, like, love, heart, night</li>
          <li><strong>Topic 2 (spending time with loves):</strong> love, time, feel, like, spend</li>
          <li><strong>Topic 3 (regret):</strong> oh, want, even, back, time</li>
          <li><strong>Topic 4 (expressing love):</strong> know, thing, said, feel, love</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It was really hard to interpret these words because a lot of the words overlapped in different topics. I knew I listened to a lot of love songs but I didn't know I listened to them this much.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-4">
        <h3>A Lot of Gray Area</h3>

        <p>A large number of songs were classified as topic 1 or dreams and hope. This seems largely due to the fact that there are many songs that did not have any lyrics and were default classified as this.</p>

        <p>For the other themes, they can be accurate to an extent. Topic 2 (spending time with loved ones) is a little broad and some of the songs include negativite encounters. I interpreted this theme to be a more positive and joyful theme.</p>
      
        <p>Topic 3 (regret) has songs with a darker tone. There were a lot of songs that fit this category but also a few songs where I weren't sure. For example, <em>You Only Live Once</em> by The Strokes is categorized under this song and while it does speak of regret, the song speaks to living life to avoid regret.</p>

        <p>I had to convert the tag information into nominal data in order to work with the data. Then I used K-means with a Jaccard clustering with a cluster size of five. I came to this cluster size from using the elbow method to find the optimal cluster size.</p>
      
        <p>Since the curve of the graph is so smooth, I just picked an aribtrary cluster size as there is no obvious elbow in the graph. I decided to go with five since it is the middle point of the curve.</p>

          <p>There are a lot of disimilar songs which answers the question of what songs are disimilar.</p>

        <h2>My Favourite Bands</h2>
        <blockquote>What’s a better way to calculate a "top artist?"</blockquote>

        <p>The way Last.fm calculates a top artist is simply by how many times you have listened to an artist. I know that for me, I tend to go through a lot of phases so my top artists are not accurate. I could listen to an artist 500 times and then never listen to them again. This metric doesn't accurately reflect what a top artist to me.</p>

        <p>The way I see a top artist is a combination of three factors:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>How consistently I listen to an artist </li>
          <li>How many different songs I listen to by an artist out of their entire discography</li>
          <li>How long they have been in my library for</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In my opinion, here are 10 artists that I feel would by my top artists, purely just from how much I like the artists. These artists are musicians that I would not hesitate to say they are one of my favourites.</p>

        <p>I don't really approve of this list because there are a couple of musicians (Versailles, Kozi, Horizon) that I feel like I don't listen to anymore. It's a bit annoying to keep seeing them on my top 10 list when they aren't particularly relevant.</p>

        <p>Out of all the artists, Thrice has the longest listening streak out of all the other artists. I've only missed listening to Thrice one month. Coheed and Cambria and DIR EN GREY are a close second.</p>

        <p>Mashrou' Leila and Marina and the Diamonds are recent additions to my music library so they don't have that much of a prescence in my library. However, out of the two, Mashrou' Leila is more consistent in listening.</p>
